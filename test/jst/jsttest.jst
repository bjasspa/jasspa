]   The JST text within a table field does not have many restrictions

    The indentation of the initial ']' is important and must align
    
    ] 2 2
    
    ] As JST supports
    
    ] tables within tables
    
    ] You can also:
    
        *. Use item lists
        
        . Like this
        
        and embed &[id logo.png 20] images
        
    ] You can also justify text, i.e.:
    
        !c Center text
        
        !r Right justify text
        
        You must get the right number of elements before you set the indent
        back.
    
]   Possible enhancements:

    1.  Specifying  the  column  widths,  this  could  be  done  on the  table
        definition line as follows:
    
            !" ]w 2 2 200 600
        
        The width definition is the same used by images 
        
    .   Join cell columns by defining the cell as ]>, i.e.
    
            >jst>
            ] 2 2
            
            ] 1, 1

            ] 2, 1

            ]> 1 and 2, 2
>end>
            
        This is easy in html,  but if this is  introduced  other  formats  may
        struggle.

]   Defining  tables as a list of elements  does not have the visual impact of
    other  methods  used in  formats  like  text2tags  but it gives the author
    complete  control  of the  layout of text  within  each cell,  allows  the
    embedding  of a table  within a table and the author does not have to mess
    around reformatting the visual look of the table when editing the text. 

]   What formats can support  tables? Text could by simply carving up the fill
    column  width by the number of columns and  rendering  the content of each
    cell in turn.  Tables  are  pretty  simple  in html,  rft is a  nightmare,
    latex??

== Variable Tag

All chapter titles start with a number defined using the **chapter** variable,
this is chapter &[v chapter]. An undefined  variable which is defined by an inc
of 8 has the  value  &[vi  not-def2  8] and if  inc'd  by 7 has a value  of &[vi
not-def2 7]. We can silently inc this by 3 &[vin not-def2 3] and then insert &[v
not-def2].
    
Following is a fig labelling and reference example
     
    &[vsn figure 0] This line had the figure variable set to 0. 

    Lets create links to both &[l  #figA]**figure  &[vr figure  figA]**  //First
    figure//&[/l] and &[l #figB]**figure &[vr figure figB]** //Second figure//&[/l].

    Here is figure A:
     
    >c &[a figA]&[i logo.png]
    Figure &[vid figure 1 figA] - First figure (figA) 
        
    Lets create links to both &[l  #figA]**figure  &[vr figure  figA]**  //First

    Figure &[vid figure 1 figB] - Secondt figure (figB)
