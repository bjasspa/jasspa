/**
 * An ObjectInputStream deserializes primitive data and objects previously
 * written using an ObjectOutputStream.
 * 
 * ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream can provide an application
 * with persistent storage for graphs of objects when used with a
 * FileOutputStream and FileInputStream respectively.
 * ObjectInputStream is used to recover those objects previously
 * serialized. Other uses include passing objects between hosts using
 * a socket stream or for marshaling and unmarshaling arguments and
 * parameters in a remote communication system.<p>
 *
 * ObjectInputStream ensures that the types of all objects in the
 * graph created from the stream match the classes present in the
 * Java Virtual Machine.  Classes are loaded as required using the
 * standard mechanisms. <p>
 *
 * Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable or
 * java.io.Externalizable interface can be read from streams.
 *
 * The method <STRONG>readObject</STRONG> is used to read an object
 * from the stream.  Java's safe casting should be used to get the
 * desired type.  In Java, strings and arrays are objects and are
 * treated as objects during serialization. When read they need to be
 * cast to the expected type.<p>
 *
 * Primitive data types can be read from the stream using the appropriate
 * method on DataInput. <p>
 * 
 * The default deserialization mechanism for objects restores the
 * contents of each field to the value and type it had when it was written.
 * Fields declared as transient or static are ignored by the
 * deserialization process.  References to other objects cause those
 * objects to be read from the stream as necessary.  Graphs of objects
 * are restored correctly using a reference sharing mechanism.  New
 * objects are always allocated when deserializing, which prevents
 * existing objects from being overwritten. <p>
 *
 * Reading an object is analogous to running the constructors of a new
 * object.  Memory is allocated for the object and initialized to zero
 * (NULL).  No-arg constructors are invoked for the non-serializable
 * classes and then the fields of the serializable classes are
 * restored from the stream starting with the serializable class closest to
 * java.lang.object and finishing with the object's most specifiec
 * class. <p>
 *
 * For example to read from a stream as written by the example in
 * ObjectOutputStream: <br>
 *
 * <PRE>
 *	FileInputStream istream = new FileInputStream("t.tmp");
 *	ObjectInputStream p = new ObjectInputStream(istream);
 *
 *	int i = p.readInt();
 *	String today = (String)p.readObject();
 *	Date date = (Date)p.readObject();
 *
 *	istream.close();
 * </PRE>
 *
 * Classes control how they are serialized by implementing either the
 * java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interfaces.<P>
 *
 * Implementing the Serializable interface allows object serialization
 * to save and restore the entire state of the object and it allows
 * classes to evolve between the time the stream is written and the time it is
 * read.  It automatically traverses references between objects,
 * saving and restoring entire graphs.
 *
 * Serializable classes that require special handling during the
 * serialization and deserialization process should implement both
 * of these methods:<p>
 *
 * <PRE>
 * private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
 *     throws IOException;
 * private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
 *     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException; 
 * </PRE><p>
 *
 * The readObject method is responsible for reading and restoring the
 * state of the object for its particular class using data written to
 * the stream by the corresponding writeObject method.  The method
 * does not need to concern itself with the state belonging to its
 * superclasses or subclasses.  State is restored by reading data from
 * the ObjectInputStream for the individual fields and making
 * assignments to the appropriate fields of the object.  Reading
 * primitive data types is supported by DataInput. <p>
 *
 * Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any
 * object that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface.
 * Subclasses of Objects that are not serializable can be
 * serializable. In this case the non-serializable class must have a
 * no-arg constructor to allow its fields to be initialized.  In this
 * case it is the responsibility of the subclass to save and restore
 * the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently the case that
 * the fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or
 * protected) or that there are get and set methods that can be used
 * to restore the state. <p>
 *
 * Any exception that occurs while deserializing an object will be
 * caught by the ObjectInputStream and abort the reading process. <p>
 *
 * Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to
 * assume complete control over the contents and format of the object's
 * serialized form.  The methods of the Externalizable interface,
 * writeExternal and readExternal, are called to save and restore the
 * objects state.  When implemented by a class they can write and read
 * their own state using all of the methods of ObjectOutput and
 * ObjectInput.  It is the responsibility of the objects to handle any
 * versioning that occurs.
