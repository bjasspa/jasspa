  <h2>History</h2>
  
  <p><em>JASSPA's</em> MicroEmacs Distribution History</p>
  
  <h2>Origins</h2>
  
  <p><b>MicroEmacs</b> was originally written by Dave Conroy in late 1985 or
  early 1986 for private use. Various people asked Dave for a copy of the
  program and it was distributed without concern for copyrights or ownership
  as was the custom of that era. Daniel Lawrence then obtained a copy of the
  program and turned it into an editor for the masses, it is his work that
  ultimately made MicroEmacs so popular. Daniel did a tremendous amount of
  work, both adding features and supporting other platforms resulting in the
  MicroEmacs v3.8 release on which JASSPA's MicroEmacs is based.</p>
  
  <p>The evolution of JASSPA's MicroEmacs starts here ...</p>
  
  <p>This version of MicroEmacs is based on an early <i>MicroEmacs</i> release
  of 3.8 in 1988 by Daniel M. Lawrence, the origins of the exact source base
  are unknown, except to say it was delivered on a unmarked 5 1/2&quot; floppy
  disk.</p>
  
  <p>The program was originally ported to a Motorola MVME147 UNIX box as an
  alternative to <b>vi</b>. Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as
  it constantly crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the development
  of JASSPA's MicroEmacs commenced.</p>
  
  <p>Development has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole
  oblivious to further developments of the existing <b>MicroEmacs</b> program.
  This was due to no Internet access. It was not until 1996 the next version
  of <b>MicroEmacs</b> and <b>mewin</b> (Microsoft Windows (TM) port of the
  same program) was downloaded from the Internet and compared. By this time
  JASSPA's MicroEmacs was radically different and we were not about to mesh
  the two together - that would be a step backwards.</p>
  
  <p>Development of JASSPA's MicroEmacs has been biased towards the UNIX
  platform, as most of the early development was performed in the UNIX domain.
  The first of the window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the
  implementation of the Microsoft Windows port. Latterly, we have seen the
  resurgence of the IBM-PC platform which is now commonplace. For the return
  port to the DOS environment, and subsequent development of the Microsoft
  Windows port, a UNIX like interface was required. Most existing users could
  not abide the primitive editors found on these machines; Microsoft Windows
  was an alien and hostile environment when compared with UNIX. Hence, the
  JASSPA's MicroEmacs interface utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across all
  platforms.</p>
  
  <p>For portability, JASSPA's MicroEmacs utilizes character rendering on all
  platforms regardless of the window manager. Under X-Windows and Microsoft
  Windows, the display is still treated as a character based display, the
  subtle difference is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that
  the scroll bars, fonts etc. are not as slick as they could be, certainly
  under Microsoft Windows JASSPA's MicroEmacs looks positively primitive!!
  Regardless of the look, the goal of a common editor across all working
  platforms has been achieved!</p>

    <li>[060921] Stopped <b>read-session(3)</b> from trying to restore lock

   <li>[060921] Improved the <B>query-replace</B> prompt to list letter
   options when the width allows.</li>
   
   <li>[060921] Browser. Added seconds to the info given for a file in a
   directory listing. Fixed dir list hooks to handle mod times with
   seconds.</li>
   
   <li>[060921] Changed char prompts to have '<TT>/</TT>' dividers.</li>
   
   <li>[060921] Added new bit 0x20 to <b>read-file(2)</b> to discard changes
   to buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[060919] Build. Added $MAKEWINDEFS and LIBS to the ME_WINDOW defines,
   removed references to xpm from the makefiles as this is not a standard
   package and moved references out of <I>emain.h</I> into <I>unixterm.c</I>.
   Vamped up build shell script to check for X11 &amp; Xpm availability.
   Changed horrid dos style empty string tests in UNIX scripts with <B>-z</B>
   &amp; <B>-n</B> test options</li>
   
   <li>[060918] Standardized the form of character input prompts and improved
   routine so '<TT>?</TT>' swaps between help and prompt. Added a
   '<TT>N(o)</TT> <TT>to</TT> <TT>all</TT>' option to

   <li>[060918] Changed debugger '<TT>!</TT>' to '<TT>c</TT>', in keeping
   with other debuggers for <I>continue</I>.</li>
   
   <li>[060918] Added bit 0x04 to <b>@mc(4)</b> flag so macro can supply a
   help string</li>
   
   <li>[060917] Corrected the X-Windows ordering to allow us to receive
   (Un)Map events on Linux - X-Server behavior is different from Sun
   Solaris.</li>
   
   <li>[060917] UNIX. Added XPM colour bitmap support. Just smartens the ME
   icon up in Gnome and makes ME look a bit more 21st century without the
   monochrome icon.</li>
   
   <li>[060917] Shell template, addition of missing common commands.</li>

   <li>[060915] OSD. Sanitised the quick file open and file type buffer open
   menus and changed them to use a scrolled list if more files/buffers than
   lines rather than filling the screen.</li>
   
   <li>[060915] In notes find a file that is loaded but out of date, this
   leads to an reread prompt during which the notes ehook/idle callback kicks
   in and changes frame - this breaks the message line of both frames. This
   is a rather horrid fix to a rather grotty problem!</li>
   
   <li>[060915] Browser, fixed the sort order to be case sensitive on UNIX,
   insensitive on Windows</li>
   
   <li>[060914] User setup. Stopped user-setup's apply from losing the
   current session's override colour scheme</li>
   
   <li>[060914] ClearCase. Fixed Describe context menu hotkey overload. Used
   <TT>-mkpath</TT> to implement a '<I>checkout parent</I>' for
   <B>cc-add</B>.</li>
   
   <li>[060913] Notes. Fixed the loosing of edit and crypt mode from the main
   notes buffer due to the setting of the major mode. Fixed notes tree
   context menu hot keys.</li>
   
   <li>[060913] Fixed kill-list tool up-date trashing the real kill ring.</li>
   
   <li>[060912] Changed session-update to store view mode for a buffer only
   if it was forced on by the user (i.e. the file is not readonly). This
   stops files re-loading in view mode if the permissions have changed - this
   was a problem with ClearCase reported by Enver Haase.</li>
   
   <li>[060912] Simplified the new note-setup and fixed the notes buffer
   losing the hide mode (which causes problems for session restore).</li>
   
   <li>[060911] Removed the notes 'note' dummy hook in favour of using a real
   hook. Set the default hook to be jst but can be set in the -!- enf;
   major-mode: &lt;hook&gt; -!- header. Added new note-setup which users
   buffer-setup to allow the user to setup the buffer and stores the values
   for that note.</li>
   
   <li>[060908] File browser, bound a <b>file-attrib(3)</b> based 'Change
   File Attributes' option to 'g'</li>
   
   <li>[060908] Changed <b>file-attrib(3)</b> to handle directory buffers
   correctly and, with a numeric arg of 0, change the attibutes of a given
   file (i.e. not the current buffer) Implementation changed to now have a
   Cancel button.</li>
   
   <li>[060908] File tool, implemented new <TT>%&quot;...%&quot;</TT> tag to
   enable proper quoting of arguments.</li>
   
   <li>[060907] Fixed startup buffer hilighting issue caused by order of
   session restore.</li>
   
   <li>[060905] ColdFusion template, added sting highlighting to the SQL
   statements.</li>
   
   <li>[060905] File browser, added binary edit, bound to 'b'.</li>
   
   <li>[060905] Added basic xml &quot;<TT>/&gt;</TT>&quot; single tag support
   to html and fixed xml's insert-attrib to handle this</li>
   
   <li>[060905] Changed refences to <I>white-char*</I> to whitespaces (i.e.
   display-white-chars is now display-whitespace) Fixed hide main menu to
   popup an info dialog informing the user how to get it back.</li>
   
   <li>[060905] Fixed ftp dialog to conform to new <I>&lt;user&gt;.erf</I>
   setup standard by adding a new 'Make Default' dialog, and improved the
   behaviour of Enter in the dialog.</li>
   
   <li>[060904] Corrected the ColdFusion closing bracket hgilight.</li>
   
   <li>[060904] Shortened the document template formating menu text
   strings.</li>
   
   <li>[060829] Fixed HTML template <B>html-insert-tag</B> to add the closing
   &quot;<TT>/</TT>&quot; on insertion of a
   &quot;<TT>&lt;singleTag/&gt;</TT>&quot;. Fixed <B>html-insert-attrib</B>
   to deal with attribute insertion into a HTML tag ending in
   &quot;<TT>/&gt;</TT>&quot;.</li>
   
   <li>[060828] SQL Template. Corrected SQL string hilighting.</li>
   
   <li>[060827] New language template for Adobe/MacroMedia ColdFusion (file
   extensions .cfm, .cfml .cfc).</li>
   
   <li>[060827] Extended indentation with the 'u' and 'v' indentation
   types.</li>
   
   <li>[060822] 2006 Release Candidate 1 (RC1)</li>
   
   <li>[060822] Added password commands <b>password-to-phonic(3)</b> and
   <b>insert-password(3)</b>. [060816] Added settings for fill-col and
   fill-mode to the <b>major-mode-setup(3)</b>.</li>
   
   <li>[060816] Added support for a &quot;<TT>.fhook-???.fill-*</TT>&quot;
   variable and changed latex over to using this variable rather than burning
   the fill-mode in as 'l'</li>
   
   <li>[060816] Crossword - Changed Exit button to Close.</li>
   
   <li>[060816] Changed organizer Exit buttons to Close or Cancel.</li>
   
   <li>[060812] Additions to the PHP script - missing tags etc.</li>
   
   <li>[060812] Corrected sun keysym inclusion - inclusion limited to
   X-Windows build only</li>
   
   <li>[060811] Fixed session resize issue and incremented the version.</li>
   
   <li>[060811] Added $buffer-fill-* variables to the buffer-setup dialog</li>
   
   <li>[060811] Stopped read-session warning about the *server* buffer being
   a process.</li>
   
   <li>[060811] Updated to use the new $buffer-fill-* variables - simplifies
   the doc hooks as ehooks and bhooks are no longer required.</li>
   
   <li>[060811] Incremented the version. MicroEmacs 06 - Date 2006/08/10 -
   sunos</li>
   
   <li>[060811] Introduced new $buffer-fill-col and $buffer-fill-mode
   variables to allow every buffer to have its own setting, initialized to
   the global variable value when the buffer is created.</li>
   
   <li>[060810] Added 'a' for All option to the save-some-buffers prompt</li>
   
   
   <li>[060810] Added save -&gt; prompt -&gt; delete of all buffers when
   loading another session. If bit 1 in arg is not set (i.e. 0 read-session
   &quot;name&quot;) then this is not done and the new session is effectively
   merged into the current.</li>
   
   <li>[060810] Added setting of main buffer modes to the buffer-setup
   osd.</li>
   
   <li>[060807] Updated emulation modes to handle the new main menu.</li>
   
   <li>[060807] Fixed major mode drop down list to not scroll
   horizontally</li>
   
   <li>[060807] A few tweaks to help with the other editor emulation.</li>
   
   <li>[060807] Fixed major-mode-setup so Cancel cancels all changes (was
   50-50)</li>
   
   <li>[060807] Removed old buffer-setup file and fixed the makefile</li>
   
   <li>[060807] Removed 'correction' of main osd - not needed and wrong.</li>
   
   
   <li>[060807] Tweaks to osd to remove a few annoyances: up on main menu now
   goes to last item of current sub menu, fixed re-frame and focus issue on
   an opened child and made C-g always just close a child even if not in
   focus.</li>
   
   <li>[060803] Added new -2 and -3 values for 2nd arg to &amp;lins to insert
   alphabetically and case insensitive alpha.</li>
   
   <li>[060803] Added setting of the major mode to the new buffer-setup</li>
   
   <li>[060803] Changed osd dialogs to use 'Cancel' or 'Close' rather than
   'Exit'</li>
   
   <li>[060803] Closed notes if open when applying changes as this corrupts
   the notes frame.</li>
   
   <li>[060803] Made the buffer sub-menu be case insensitively ordered in
   windows and have first letter hotkeys.</li>
   
   <li>[060803] Changed frame-id comparison to use seq as should handle
   &quot;ERROR&quot; better.</li>
   
   <li>[060803] Fixed notes to handle a reread-file type operation.</li>
   
   <li>[060803] Changed osd dialogs to use 'Cancel' or 'Close' rather than
   'Exit'</li>
   
   <li>[060802] Added saving the session to save-all and associated a file in
   $user-path with the File-&gt;New command.</li>
   
   <li>[060801] Set .gz extracted buffer name and file name so its location
   is kept.</li>
   
   <li>[060728] Fixed clear-case to handle multi-line comments with SHELL set
   to csh.</li>
   
   <li>[060728] Changed &quot;symbol&quot; to &quot;insert-symbol&quot; and
   &quot;indent-setup&quot; to &quot;buffer-setup&quot; as this is what it
   will become. Fixed a few hot-key issues with new main menu.</li>
   
   <li>[060728] Improved help page and looked for context-menu binding to
   support esc&nbsp;+.</li>
   
   <li>[060728] Moved the location of making CVS and clear-case always
   available into their setup dialog and added a C-x C-q replacement
   option.</li>
   
   <li>[060728] Changed backspace in a directory to move to the sub-directory
   in the parent listing.</li>
   
   <li>[060728] Fixed notes startup so it returns the user to the same
   place.</li>
   
   <li>[060728] Documentation, replaced -ve with negative and +ve with
   positive.</li>
   
   <li>[060726] gdiff. Added termcap friendly key bindings to move between
   difference regions.</li>
   
   <li>[060726] Added new indent-increase and indent-decrease macros. Added
   indent increase and decrease to format, changed notes binding to f8, move
   shell tools from tools to advanced and setup commands into tools.</li>
   
   <li>[060726] Fixed setting of scheme when session file does not exist
   (problem hit when old user uses session for first time)</li>
   
   <li>[060725] Changed goto commands to not stop the show-region
   highlight</li>
   
   <li>[060725] Major rearrangement of the main menu, replaced the Insert and
   Execute sub-menus with a View and Advanced, re-balanced and relocated many
   items, most notably the setup dialogs out of Help into Advanced.</li>
   
   <li>[060725] Renamed the existing tool-bar macro to toolbar-open (mirrors
   existing toolbar-close) and introduced a new tool-bar macro that toggles
   state, i.e. closes if opened. This command is more useful in key-bindings
   and menus etc.</li>
   
   <li>[060725] Improved error handling of osd based find tag, also adding
   support for tags file being in a parent directory.</li>
   
   <li>[060725] Removed command-line validation and relax file selection
   requirement so user can create a tool that does not require a file name
   (e.g. open . in explorer)</li>
   
   <li>[060725] Used set/goto-position to store current dot and added &lt;no
   favorites&gt; entry if menu is empty.</li>
   
   <li>[060725] Added hot-keys to the file attrib dialog</li>
   
   <li>[060725] Changed simply fence matching of quotes and double quotes, if
   match is not found by the end or start of the line it's assumed to be a
   single and ignored.</li>
   
   <li>[060725] Changed &amp;mid so the 3rd argument (length) can be -ve to
   mean from the right (as per the &amp;rig etc) - not sure why this was not
   done first time round.</li>
   
   <li>[060624] Changed session support to handle both window and console
   environments. Changed startup to only initialize one scheme.</li>
   
   <li>[060623] Added file-type-setup to the list of misc setups.</li>
   
   <li>[060622] Changed buffer-setup to major-mode-setup, also changed
   buffer-help to major-mode-help etc and fixed comments. Left buffer-setup
   in buffstp as there will be a buffer-setup which really does setup up the
   current buffer. Change me.emf date to 20060606</li>
   
   <li>[060620] Stopped session trying to change the frame for a console
   run.</li>
   
   <li>[060619] Sessions. Stopped restore buffer's whose file does not exist
   and changed the order of frame size setting so on UNIX the depth of
   windows are maintained correctly</li>
   
   <li>[060619] Notes. Fixed current buffer position reset problem caused by
   buffer being shown on hidden notes frame</li>
   
   <li>[060619] Changed all ME setup macros to reload the /history registry
   before change the registry and writing it out as soon as the changes are
   accepted to reduce the likelihood of settings (like new alias paths) being
   lost. One except is when the setup is run from within user-setup in which
   case the registry is only read and written by user-setup, this could have
   some unwanted side effects. Added session-setup to the user-setup misc
   page.</li>
   
   <li>[060619] Change to allow macros access to inactive buffers broke file
   and ipipe hooks which get executed but the buffer is officially made
   active - fixed by maintaining the BIFNACT internal flag and ensuring the
   algorithm used for inactive buffers is only used wh ere appropriate. Found
   buffer context was not set correctly for session buffers whose name was
   set to 'name&lt;1&gt;' as the BIFNAME flag is not set, fixed by removing
   this flag and using code to assess if the &lt;1&gt; should be removed
   based on the filename.</li>
   
   <li>[060619] Fixed read-registry's replace mode which was doing a merge as
   the old node was not removed.</li>
   
   <li>[060619] Fixed a bad prompt and added a couple of brackets to protect
   compare order.</li>
   
   <li>[060616] Changed the start-up process to not use the history commands
   (which have been removed) but simply use the read-registry commands.</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Moved the storage of all history type info into the new
   session (esf) files.</li>
   
   <li>[060615] $user-name.erf only contains setup info and not often edited
   changed user setup to minimize the likelihood of losing edits (at
   last).</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Broken session-setup out into its own macro file and made
   quite a few fixes to the new session support.</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Removed the save- and read-history commands the me.emf
   start-up now simply use the read-registry command</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Changed find-buffer to allow limited access to inactive
   buffers (allows base getting and setting of variables)</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Changed the exit-emacs numeric argument (again) so it can be
   used by meDie (0x28 exit-emacs ~= emergency exit)</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Created new $window-mark-line &amp; $window-mark-col to aid
   inactive buffer support (not sure why these were not already there as they
   are usefully in macros)</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Enabled availability of save-some-buffers by default
   (quick-exit relies on this!)</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Changed the -c command-line option to simply set the variable
   %session-name (relies on session macros)</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Changed clipboard support to not mess with it during start-up
   and shut-down</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Created new change-scheme command.</li>
   
   <li>[060615] ClearCase. Fixed *cc-state* buffer not being in view mode
   when command completes.</li>
   
   <li>[060615] Corrected types of exchange-point-and-mark.</li>
   
   <li>[060608] Improved OSD search dialog by making the buttons always
   enabled and reporting an error if search string is empty.</li>
   
   <li>[060608] Made the existing hidden scheme macro a visible command which
   can be used to change the current color scheme. Set .scheme.current to the
   file name of the current scheme Saved the current scheme in a session so a
   user can create a session with its own different scheme.</li>
   
   <li>[060526] Sessions. Changed to use new shut-down pseudo key.</li>
   
   <li>[060526] Changed shut-down process to call the ehooks for the current
   buffer of all frames and changed the shut-down macro to a pseudo
   key-binding.</li>
   
   <li>[060525] Added a new buffer-major-mode command to change the current
   buffer's hook, giving it an arg of -1 or major mode of &quot;&quot;
   removes the hook. No completion list yet. Fixed tab-width setting so all 3
   windows get the same new value.</li>
   
   <li>[060525] Changed gdiff to insert the 2 files into temp buffers so if
   the files are already loaded by the user these buffers are not effected.
   Added the ability to set the tab width.</li>
   
   <li>[060525] Fixed crash caused by watch refreshing the buffer while user
   is using isearch - stopped watch from refreshing the buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[060525] Added a new bit 0x10 to find- read- and view-file to disable
   the context fhook evaluation.</li>
   
   <li>[060525] UNIX fix. Call screenUpdate directly after a window resize -
   fixes gdiff update problem.</li>
   
   <li>[060523] Sessions. First serious rev of session-load and -save.</li>
   
   <li>[060523] Added arg to tool-bar to allow the tool-bar to be initialized
   without re-reading the registry - required by new session support.</li>
   
   <li>[060523] Changed left click on mode line to change to the window if
   the mouse is not moved.</li>
   
   <li>[060523] Fixed C++ '::&lt;function&gt;() ;' indentation bug introduced
   with c++ initialize ': &lt;base-init&gt; ()' indentation support.</li>
   
   <li>[060523] Encrypted files. Added file/host to the password prompt so on
   a -c the user should know which password is required.</li>
   
   <li>[060523] Fixed UNIX compiler warnings</li>
   
   <li>[060516] me.emf. Fixed missing def of file-type-setup &amp;
   shell-tool-setup.</li>
   
   <li>[060515] Added new bit 0x2 to arg for change-buffer-name which force
   the buffer to have the given name, changing the name of an existing buffer
   if required.</li>
   
   <li>[060512] ClearCase. Fixed cc-setup view deletion, pressing No does not
   remove it. Removed the temporary file created by cc-diff if me's diff of
   gdiff are used, file is still left if xdiff is used.</li>
   
   <li>[060512] Added a new $mode-chars variable which returns the letter ids
   of all modes as a string, this variable cannot currently be set.</li>
   
   <li>[060512] Changed the numeric arguments for quick-exit and
   save-buffers-exit-emacs to make them simple to use.</li>
   
   <li>[060510] Improved the ftp logging so errors get put into the console
   with error numbers rather than just mlwrite'd. Removed the KEEPALIVE as ME
   closes the sockets with 10mins anyway. Fix the ftp kb/s calc.</li>
   
   <li>[060510] Dirlist. Fixed context menu so the FTP additions are added
   for any ftp:// listing.</li>
   
   <li>[060504] Major addition to notes: a) Added forw/back note. b) added
   notes-instant and notes-context c) implemented notes-session-save (not
   done window layout yet) but not implemented the matching load yet. d)
   fixed a few annoying up-date and behavior problems.</li>
   
   <li>[060504] ClearCase. Fixed windows \\r\\n issue with diff - constructed
   predecessor could have the wrong format breaking the diff.</li>
   
   <li>[060504] Changed reyank numeric arg so if a -ve arg is given reyank
   will fail if at the end of the kill chain rather than loop - required for
   notes-session-save</li>
   
   <li>[060504] Found differences between copy and kill-region's handling of
   narrows, particularly if there's no markup line Found I could crash ME if
   only the end part of a narrow-to is killed - buffer line number all go
   wrong. To fix the issues I've created a standard function to handle the
   expansion of narrows over a region and made the rule that for a narrow
   without a markup line to be included in the region at least the \\n of the
   previous line and 1 char of the container line must be included, this
   means that narrows at the top and bottom cannot be included.</li>
   
   <li>[060504] ClearCase. Fixed cc-merge comment bug.</li>
   
   <li>[060504] Added support for a .ascii-time.format variable which defines
   the format for the output using '%' tags as per strftime function
   (supports most tags) - output is unchanged if variable is not set. Fixes
   request by Dick Pierce. Changed the OSD insert time function to use the
   same tokens and made the first format in the list be the output of
   ascii-time.</li>
   
   <li>[060503] Provided macro interface to get a list of alpha marks for the
   current buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[060427] Fixed context-menu element activation issue caused by
   selected file count being wrong.</li>
   
   <li>[060427] Fixed notes and gdiff window resize issues by locking the
   size.</li>
   
   <li>[060426] Improved (but not quite fully fixed and I don't think I can)
   the mouse word selection when the word is half hidden at the left or right
   edge of the window.</li>
   
   <li>[060425] Fixed bug with setting $window-line, if value is &lt; 1 then
   the goto-line function prompts the user, this is incorrect behavior for a
   set variable command and the cause of a mouse driver spin. Fixed mouse
   left button spin caused by missing the pick event and a bug in
   set-variable for $window-line. Added new horizontal scroll feature when
   user clicks on a $window-char truncated line char.</li>
   
   <li>[060421] JSP. Fixed java &lt;%...%&gt; within JavaScript start
   token</li>
   
   <li>[060421] Fixed C++ comment hilighting</li>
   
   <li>[060413] Added an abort-command safty trap to reset the $buffer-input
   variable.</li>
   
   <li>[060413] JSP. Fixed most JSP hilight and indent issues caused by java
   and javascript confusions.</li>
   
   <li>[060412] Bug fix. Put checks in to ensure the hilight/indent to be
   used according to a look-back scheme has been defined - fixes crash when
   viewing JSP files.</li>
   
   <li>[060403] DIRECTORY LISTING. Fixed 'not-exist' fix in last commit - ftp
   dir lists can be only a couple of lines Made file/dir copy automatically
   try 3 times before prompting the user (large ftp copies will fail at
   points). Fixed browse mode close problem when browse deletes the buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[060402] Used an ehook and a callback to auto detect a change in the
   notes frame buffer/window layout, if there is a change the callback closes
   the notes frame. This approach resolves many issues.</li>
   
   <li>[060331] Fixed XML magic hook.</li>
   
   <li>[060331] Fix annoying find-zfile last buffer history change. Changed
   the buffer &amp; file name of a loaded zfile file to something more
   useful.</li>
   
   <li>[060331] Created a '2 find-buffer &lt;file-name&gt;' arg which finds
   an existing buffer via its file name - used to fix annoying find-zfile
   buffer history change.</li>
   
   <li>[060330] Fixed CVS &amp; CC context menu placement issues. Fixed
   cc-add to use -mkpath for directories</li>
   
   <li>[060330] Change fhook-dir to always detect if its a source-controlled
   dir and call the SC hook, the SC hook can then add its own bindings etc.
   Fixed fhook-dir so loading of &quot;.../not-exist/&quot; does not
   error.</li>
   
   <li>[060330] Made the esc = &amp; esc + menu bindings global.</li>
   
   <li>[060329] Changed unix start-up mode to favor X over termcap if DISPLAY
   is set, even if term is a vt100.</li>
   
   <li>[060329] Fixed mode-line udate bug when all edits are undone -
   reported by Tom Hundt.</li>
   
   <li>[060322] Fixed the position of the context menu when opened by mouse
   or menu key. Fixed auto-spell not being available when context menu is
   opened using the menu key.</li>
   
   <li>[060322] Improved gdiff-next command to error at the end of the file
   so the use knows they have reached the end. Bound 'menu' to open the
   contex menu and bound 'esc up' &amp; 'esc down' to move between unassigned
   sections.</li>
   
   <li>[060322] Bound f10 to close the notes frame and bound C-x k to a new
   notes-delete command</li>
   
   <li>[060317] ClearCase. Added new cc-merge command (which uses cleartool's
   findmerge command!). Added new cc-describe command (which uses cleartool's
   describe command), fixed the CC context menu.</li>
   
   <li>[060317] Directory listing. Increased 2Gb directory file size limit to
   4Gb by making size variables meUInt.</li>
   
   <li>[060317] Fixed '\\' quoting in command-wait example.</li>
   
   <li>[060316] Up-dated docs for command-wait, added some meaty examples and
   added cross references to them.</li>
   
   <li>[060316] indent fix</li>
   
   <li>[060316] Changed describe-word osd dialog so that it has a 'Look Up'
   button which is the default. Also improved the insert description process
   so C-w kills the description inserted.</li>
   
   <li>[060316] Improved the behaviour of the enter key in the help osd so it
   does a search or nothing.</li>
   
   <li>[060315] Fixed a win32 console crash caused by the new frame
   reposition function. Stopped the messing about of the windows console when
   ME is in piped mode.</li>
   
   <li>[060309] Fixed regex \\a -&gt; \\g for bell and added support for \\a
   &amp; \\m to [...] character classes.</li>
   
   <li>[060309] Updated *shell-command docs.</li>
   
   <li>[060309] Documented &amp;lef, &amp;mid &amp; &amp;rig -ve 2nd arg
   usage.</li>
   
   <li>[060309] Documented insert-string's -ve arg.</li>
   
   <li>[060309] Up-dated goto-matching-fence docs</li>
   
   <li>[060309] Fixed docs for when no arg is given to forward-kill-word.</li>
   
   <li>[060309] Updated jst template to new version. Fixed a couple of bugs
   with tables (empty cells and bad indent) Implemented a table cell '!' flag
   to indicate a start of a row (helps debugging) Fixed bug when title
   variable not set.</li>
   
   <li>[060309] ClearCase. Minor improvement to setup layout</li>
   
   <li>[060222] Exit handling fixed, saving of modified buffers, history,
   spell dictionaries etc. &quot;**Emergency Exit**&quot; messages removed
   from exit handling.</li>
   
   <li>[060214] Corrected user setup mouse defaults - missing wheel mouse
   default bindings.</li>
   
   <li>[060214] Improved the php look-back scheme to identify php script
   quicker.</li>
   
   <li>[060213] Fixed crash caused by the new hilight look back scheme using
   the indent look back function which used the indent scheme rather than the
   hilight scheme</li>
   
   <li>[060210] Improved php hilighting by making use of the new
   look-back-scheme and look-back-only-token features.</li>
   
   <li>[060210] Improved the time printout</li>
   
   <li>[060210] Benchmark tests. Improved the disptest.</li>
   
   <li>[060210] ClearCase. Fixed cc-add when adding just a directory.</li>
   
   <li>[060210] Added basic mouse support to browser and honours exit
   bindings</li>
   
   <li>[060210] Added look-back-scheme support to hilighting (uses same code
   as indents quick-lookback scheme). Added new 'only use during look-back'
   hilight token (combined 0x800 &amp; 0x200) which can solve make multi-line
   string hilighting issues.</li>
   
   <li>[060210] Fixed compiler warning with -m changes</li>
   
   <li>[060210] Removed unused variable in new reposition function</li>
   
   <li>[060210] Fixed unused variable on NDEBUG build</li>
   
   <li>[060209] Made changes to the -m server message option to make it
   usable. a) Process the message using the macro 'token' function so \\n is
   translated to a new-line char. b) If the message is not terminated with a
   \\n then one is added. c) The popup-window message it only given when -o
   option is used</li>
   
   <li>[060209] Added support for a server 'M' message command.</li>
   
   <li>[060209] Changed the hilight and indent meHilight structure mis-uses
   access the data via #define (added to estruct.h) so the code is clean and
   easy to read and the miss uses can be easily found and changed. Changed
   the storage of the main indent and hilight scheme flags to use the ignore
   field (only 5 bits currently used) so the trunc scheme can use the type
   and the hilight look back can use the close (i.e. unlimited).</li>
   
   <li>[060209] Fixed clear-case update list on checkin option.</li>
   
   <li>[060208] Fixed crash caused by mlGetStringFromUser being called
   recursively - only possible since the introduction of ftp completion which
   can prompt for the user password while inputting a file name.</li>
   
   <li>[060207] Added an implementation of meFrameRepositionWindow for XTerm,
   not a very good one as there is not a clear standard between WMs.</li>
   
   <li>[060207] Fixed obscure crash caused by horizonal scroll mode 2 and
   long lines.</li>
   
   <li>[060202] Build script. Fixed MS-Window's typo.</li>

   closing the window with loading a file from a dir list.</li>
   
   <li>[060127] Broke the user-setup 'Tools' 'File Types' and 'EMail' pages
   out into separate independent setup dialogs. Added new Miscellaneous page
   to user-setup with links to these and other setup dialogs (such as
   alias-path and file-tool) Changed the buttons to the more standard Okay,
   Apply Cancel. Slightly changed some of the Mail &amp; VM registry settings
   to make each platform independent (except filtering).</li>
   
   <li>[060127] ClearCase. Added new cc-delete and alias-path-setup commands.
   Added f4 to diff binding. Moved the window resizing call to nearer the end
   (after the font resize as this could change to a smaller font allowing
   more lines etc).</li>
   
   <li>[060127] Fixed quite a few issues with the CVS and clear-case UI
   interfaces. Brought cvs-state into line with CC, implemented cc-delete and
   rationalised the hot-keys and context menus.</li>
   
   <li>[060127] Added new alias-path-setup OSD gui.</li>
   
   <li>[060127] Added new 3 and 4 arg to popup-window to manipulate the main
   frame window, implemented meFrameRepositionWindow function on windows.</li>
   
   <li>[060127] Fixed find-reg index in error message.</li>
   
   <li>[060127] Moved macro parser's \\a to \\g (bell) and added support for
   \\a - alpha and \\m - alpha-num to hilight and regex.</li>
   
   <li>[060125] Changed the default debug for 'deb' abbrev to 2.</li>
   
   <li>[060125] Improved the hilighting of html &amp;???; chars - issue
   raised by Tom Hundt</li>
   
   <li>[060124] Fixed crash caused by moving right (cursor key) into a
   sub-menu with no active items - bug found by Tom Hundt.</li>
   
   <li>[060122] gdiff. Fixed the bugs introduced with the 3rd 'current line'
   window was introduced.</li>
   
   <li>[060122] Changed call from saveExitEmacs to exitEmacs to avoid compile
   errors for NE.</li>
   
   <li>[060122] Fixed the meDie function to not exit straight after the
   emergency exit message, now autosaves as it should. Change the handling of
   the CLOSE message on windows so it prompts okay/cancel if buffers need
   saving and then exits. Fixed really annoying modifier state mismatch
   problem on windows - reproduce by pressing control right-click on title
   bar to get the system menu and then release the control, ME misses the
   C-drop event so thinks its still pressed.</li>
   
   <li>[051220] JST extensions.</li>
   
   <li>[051219] JST. Added implementation of TOC to html export.</li>
   
   <li>[051219] ClearCase. Disable check out of parent dir for cc-add as its
   not implemented</li>
   
   <li>[051215] JST. Changed tag highlighting to handle split line tags
   correctly. Implemented support for f and b color export to HTML using
   style.</li>
   
   <li>[051215] First commit of new v4 JST format hook and export macros.</li>
   
   <li>[051215] Fixed the return value of transpose-lines command which was
   always returning false causing cc-add to fail.</li>
   
   <li>[051212] SQL Template. Missing hilight statement causes execution to
   fail - Thanks to Th.</li>
   
   <li>[051212] Fixes to old JST before it gets trashed</li>
   
   <li>[051125] Fixed regex bug where &quot;[\\s]&quot; incorrectly matches
   an 's'</li>
   
   <li>[051125] ClearCase. Added support for not loaded to cc-state</li>
   
   <li>[051123] Added support for alias-paths.</li>
   
   <li>[051122] Fixed highlight problems with &quot;^ *$&quot; &amp;
   &quot;^\\\\s*$&quot; close bracket tags, they should match any line
   containing only spaces/white-spaces but they did not work reliably.</li>
   
   <li>[051122] ClearCase. Fixed the cc-diff, external diff settings had got
   muddled.</li>
   
   <li>[051122] Directory listing. Changed the size ordering to list largest
   first on initial sort.</li>
   
   <li>[051118] ClearCase. Implemented the auto get checkout comment and
   removed the temp command-line buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[051118] Directory listing window. Added binding of 'f' to toggle the
   filter and changed the 's' and 'S' bindings round (s is far more
   useful)</li>
   
   <li>[051118] Improved the horizontal scrolling of gdiff and browse</li>
   
   <li>[051110] Make debugger stop at executed !elif &amp; !else will work
   for all macros, may not work when executing a buffer as the line may start
   with a white space.</li>
   
   <li>[051110] Stopped osd check-box macros from triggering the debugger
   when $debug is set to 1.</li>
   
   <li>[051110] Added some more key translations based on bug report by
   Francesco Abbate.</li>
   
   <li>[051104] 2nd and much improved version of cc-setup. Changed to using
   -1 insert-string to allow multi-line comments. Fixed horrid problem with
   cleartool's handling of checking out a file when its been hijacked, no
   command-line option to make it use the hijacked file me has to use
   ipipe-write a send 'yes' at the prompt, but as the prompt is not given me
   must be preempt and send them first, one for each file - clear-case is
   pants and cleartool sucks.</li>
   
   <li>[051104] Changed cmd-line construction to use -1 insert-string to
   insert \\n's into the line - not really very nice.</li>
   
   <li>[051104] Fixed meGetChar to be like GetString in that if running a
   macro the value has not been given it goes directly to the user rather
   than simply failing, this improves macro reliability and eases debugging
   of macros.</li>
   
   <li>[051104] Multi-line shell fix. The new 0x100 flag to shell-command has
   one drawback, you cannot run commands that include newline characters as
   the cmd-line must be on the first line. But CVS and clear-case commit
   comments are often multi-line so this is not acceptable. To fix the
   problem I have added a -ve arg to insert-string comment which then
   performs a literal insertion, i.e. every char including a \\n char is
   inserted are text. This fixes the immediate problem but inserting a \\n
   char in a line can break other thing in a very major way (like undo) so it
   must be used with extreme care.</li>
   
   <li>[051103] ClearCase. First rev of a CC tool defaults setup in cc-setup.
   Moved CC over to using 0x100 bit in shell-command to remove command-line
   length limit.</li>
   
   <li>[051102] Moved multiple-file file-tool executions over to using the
   new 0x100 shell-command flag (first line of buffer) to remove command-line
   length limit in almost all cases (cmd has a 4kb limit)</li>
   
   <li>[051102] Introduced a new 0x100 bit for shell commands which means the
   'cmd-line' given is a buffer names whose first line holds the command-line
   to run.</li>
   
   <li>[051028] ClearCase. Fixed cc-diff abort when a file has no differences.
   Added a 'delete line' function to cc-state bound to C-k.</li>
   
   <li>[051019] Visual basic highlighting - added And Or and Xor
   operators.</li>
   
   <li>[051013] Unix shell window, corrected highlighting of backslash escape
   character outside of a string enclosure.</li>
   
   <li>[051011] ClearCase extensions. Added button to cc-checkin to get
   checkout comment. In cc-state - fixed file selection on last empty line
   and mouse selection and added support for mouse drag selection.</li>
   
   <li>[051011] Changed dirlist copy/move to preserve the original files time
   stamp.</li>
   
   <li>[051011] Fixed windows rename to check the to name is case
   insensitively different.</li>
   
   <li>[051011] Implemented file time-stamp preservation in the file-op copy
   and move.</li>
   
   <li>[051011] Improved the window-popup on windows, more likely to work but
   can still fail.</li>
   
   <li>[051011] Fixed UNIX drag-n-drop, broken by -l l:c addition.</li>
   
   <li>[051007] Integrated Ric Yeates command line <B>-l
   &lt;line&gt;:&lt;col&gt;</B> submission - thanks for the submission.</li>
   
   <li>[051007] ClearCase. Removed VOB option from <B>cc-state</B> as it did
   not work. Made <B>cc-console</B> read only and better integrated including
   supporting it as a toolbar tool (like cvs-console).</li>
   
   <li>[051007] Fixed bad variable assignment in directory list macros.</li>
   
   <li>[051001] Corrected Sun Solaris x86 makefile to use the Sun Native
   compiler.</li>
   
   <li>[050930] ClearCase. Fixed <B>cc-state</B> to check the state of
   selected directories, which requires a double cleartool call (horrid
   command-line) Added support for config-spec viewing and editing. Added
   directory refresh option for checkin/out add etc. Added many improvements
   to cc-state buffer support, hilighting, file listing style sorting and
   selection (i.e. following are bound
   <TT>1</TT>,<TT>2</TT>,<TT>3</TT>,<TT>+</TT>,<TT>-</TT>,<TT>u</TT>,<TT>a</TT>,<TT>*</TT>)</li>
   
   <li>[050930] <B>file-tool</B>, changed the buffer list toolbar tool to
   keep the current line to the current buffer when using <B>find-buffer</B>
   etc.</li>
   
   <li>[050930] Latest <I>Mirkwood</I> update from Bruno.</li>
   
   <li>[050930] Fixed ftp drag'n'drop copy bug, the source dir needed an
   file: prefix to remove the <TT>ftp://</TT> of the current buffer. While
   test I blew away my home directory, nasty way to discover that ftp can
   return <TT>&quot;..&quot;</TT> not <TT>&quot;../&quot;</TT> and
   <TT>&quot;..&quot;</TT> is not ignored when deleting! Fixed.</li>
   
   <li>[050929] File listing, stopped copy, move etc commands from accepting
   <TT>'../'</TT> when its the current line Fixed <TT>'v'</TT> browse file
   open and close.</li>
   
   <li>[050928] browse, removed the delete buffer flag from browse - wrong
   way to do this.</li>
   
   <li>[050928] ClearCase, make <B>cc-annotate</B> work if file is checked
   out (cleartool command-line is awful, why do you have to pay money to use
   this rubbish?)</li>
   
   <li>[050928] Added wrap feature to <B>browse</B> mode.</li>
   
   <li>[050928] Changed <I>Mirkwood</I> main OSD scheme to make current focus
   item more visible.</li>
   
   <li>[050920] Changed the $debug variable to be bit based as its old values
   just could implement the required functionality.</li>
   
   <li>[050920] Latest <I>Mirkwood</I> highlight scheme - added underlining
   for spelling errors</li>
   
   <li>[050920] OAD, added a comment tab to the scheme editor and up-graded
   the scheme selectors to use combo-boxes.</li>
   
   <li>[050920] Fixed compile error on macos caused by bad macro
   definition.</li>
   
   <li>[050919] Fixed 2 bugs: meRegHead's force could be left set to 1 which
   has the side effect of <TT>C-g</TT> not hiding the active region. Due to
   last change to <B>command-wait</B> the screen is not up-dated before
   waiting for a key breaking <B>gdiff</B>.</li>
   
   <li>[050919] Readability update to <I>Mirkwood</I> highlight scheme.</li>
   
   <li>[050919] Changed ClearCase <B>cc-state</B> to handle file names with
   '<TT>[</TT>'s in them.</li>
   
   <li>[050915] Added Up, Down, Hide window and default open options to the
   <B>file-tool</B> setup GUI. Added support for a default open to the
   directory listing, pressing return now checks for a <B>file-tool</B>
   default open (explorerish), '<TT>o</TT>' for open always loads the file
   into me.</li>
   
   <li>[050915] Added support for dbx on sunos. Changed the ipipe input mode
   to be toggled using <TT>f3</TT> rather than set via <TT>f2</TT>,
   <TT>f3</TT> or <TT>f4</TT>.</li>
   
   <li>[050915] <B>zfile</B>, fixed filename -&gt; absolute file name when
   given as an macro arg - should be based off current buffer's path.</li>
   
   <li>[050908] Added <B>file-tool</B>.</li>
   
   <li>[050908] ClearCase, fixed <TT>%diff-com</TT> definition problem and
   <B>cc-uncheckout</B> buffer update problem. Fixed <B>cc-checkout</B> and
   <B>cc-checkin</B> buffer update problems as well.</li>
   
   <li>[050908] Improved the diff highlight, more readable and correct.</li>
   
   <li>[050908] Added new <I>Mirkwood</I> highlight scheme.</li>
   
   <li>[050806] Added better support for MinGW. Fixed the console color bug
   and most of the compiler warnings. Added support for the MSYS shell by
   creating a unix style <TT>mingw.gmk</TT> (uses rm instead of del etc)
   updating the old <TT>mingw.gmk</TT> and renamed to <TT>mingw32.gmk</TT>
   and added support to the unix build script.</li>
   
   <li>[050803] Fixed <B>ne</B> crash when an unbound key is pressed, bug
   introduced with last commits.</li>
   
   <li>[050721] Fixed annoying mouse refocus in osd dialog even though mouse
   is not moved - another windows nasty.</li>
   
   <li>[050720] File browser, added directory closing binding to '<TT>c</TT>'
   and '<TT>+</TT>' '<TT>-</TT>' windows compatible bindings.</li>
   
   <li>[050720] Pop-up menus, shifted the context menu down one line when
   opened by a key.</li>
   
   <li>[050720] Directory listing. Changed the tag file list macro to support
   moving to the closest selected so the user can see which files they are
   deleting! Improved the file-tool so <TT>\\H</TT> will see a hot-key,
   '<TT>\\</TT>' chars and '<TT>&quot;</TT>' must be quoted (i.e.
   '<TT>\\\\</TT>' &amp; '<TT>\&quot;</TT>') Bound '<TT>t</TT>' to open the
   file tool menu directly so tools can be easily executed without use of the
   mouse.</li>
   
   <li>[050720] Source code reorganisation. Standardized the # preprocess
   forms, removed 2 uses of #elif and cplusplus and changed odd
   '<TT>defined(_BSD)</TT>' style bracketing which the <B>c-hash-eval</B>
   does not handle.</li>
   
   <li>[050720] Removed unused functionality from NE. Made the following
   available as extended functionality: <B>backward-delete-tab</B>,
   <B>change-buffer-name</B>, <B>change-file-name</B>,
   <B>define-macro-file</B>, <B>delete-blank-lines</B>,
   <B>delete-some-buffers</B>, <B>named-buffer-mode</B>,
   <B>save-some-buffers</B>, <B>save-buffers-exit-emacs</B>,
   user(<TT>%</TT>), buffer(<TT>:</TT>) and command(<TT>.</TT>) variables,
   <B>$buffer-input</B>, <B>$kept-versions</B>, <B>$mouse*</B>.
   <B>$pause-time</B>, <B>$MEBACKUPPATH</B>. Removed <B>-c</B> from ne's help
   page as this is not supported. Moved macro regex <B>&amp;xseq</B>,
   <B>&amp;xrep</B> based directives and most <B>@</B> variables to extended
   functionality.</li>
   
   <li>[050719] Organiser address search broken due to recent changes to
   macro argument getting. Fixed by changing the numeric argument which was
   ambiguously defined.</li>
   
   <li>[050718] Source code reorganisation. Made the file hook variables and
   HideBuffer function statics. Changed ne to use fixed char groups for
   isUpper etc rather than the large look-up tables as it does not have
   <B>set-char-mask</B> to configure them anyway.</li>
   
   <li>[050718] C template. Fixed and greatly simplified the #if handling in
   the hash eval code. Added support for <TT>#undef</TT>.</li>
   
   <li>[050715] Source code organisation. Removed unused code when there's no
   ipipe support. Hashed out location functions which are only required by
   socket or ipipe support.</li>
   
   <li>[050714] Combined <B>cc-log</B> and <B>cc-annotate</B> into a single
   <B>cc-annotate</B> cammon with GUI. Added <B>cc-vtree</B> and
   <B>cc-explorer</B>.</li>
   
   <li>[050714] Fixed <B>user-setup</B> setting of number of backups and
   Ignore files settings.</li>
   
   <li>[050714] Fixed <B>file-op</B> copy so the source file's attributes are
   preserved (i.e. remains read only etc). Implemented the 4th parameter
   (attribs) in <B>&amp;stat&nbsp;i</B> Implemented a <B>file-op</B> chmod
   using arg bit <TT>0x200</TT>.</li>
   
   <li>[050712] Corrected NE build under Windows, console build including
   windows calls.</li>
   
   <li>[050712] Directory listing, fixed delete copy and move prompts, flag
   <TT>0x08</TT> got changed to <TT>0x04</TT> in <B>file-op</B>.</li>
   
   <li>[050712] Implemented a proper ClearCase context diff by recreating the
   old file from the diff and then calling a real diff program.</li>
   
   <li>[050712] Changed the diff hilighting to be just one scheme as a CC diff
   could contain a gdiff style for files and diff style for directories.</li>
   
   <li>[050712] Corrected NE build problem with macro debugging.</li>
   
   <li>[050711] Corrected Latex template load error in <TT>hklatex.emf</TT>
   (detected with <TT>$debug=1</TT>).</li>
   
   <li>[050710] Fixed old <TT>$debug</TT> interface, found a long forgotton
   mode 3 (now 4) which simply prints the current line without waiting, this
   broken the new mode 3.</li>
   
   <li>[050709] Removed the <B>-d</B> command line option - pointless.</li>
   
   <li>[050709] Improved the macro command argument handling to get missing
   arguments from the user, i.e. having a macro line of: <B>fine-file</B>
   Works okay.</li>
   
   <li>[050709] Vastly improved the macro debugging, the <B>$debug</B> value
   of 1 is now 2, 2 -&gt; 3, a value of 1 now tells the user of any unhandled
   failures.</li>
   
   <li>[050709] Fixed the Windows window resizing behaviour to be a lot more
   usable. The window size now increases in character size steps rather than
   bouncing around and the window is refresh as its changed. The Horizontal
   width limit of the window has effectively been removed (set to 400 chars)
   the depth is still restricted to the screen size, issue raised by Tom
   Hundt.</li>
   
   <li>[050709] Added new file tools interface, creating windows explorer
   type file name based tools (e.g. extracting a zip file).</li>
   
   <li>[050709] Added ClearCase <B>cc-log</B> and <B>cc-annotate</B> (similar
   to cvs's commands)</li>
   
   <li>[050709] Stopped the default file hook from creating a bogus tool menu
   and help page.</li>
   
   <li>[050709] Fixed the previous-line macro and the kill-word key
   bindings.</li>
   
   <li>[050709] Changed the menu items which open a sub dialog to having
   '<TT>...</TT>' in their name as per the gui standard, issue raised by Tom
   Hundt.</li>
   
   <li>[050708] Changed sub-menu display chars, auto open menus are now '
   <TT>&gt;</TT>' and manual are '<TT>+</TT>', issue raised by Tom Hundt.</li>
   
   <li>[050708] Got thoroughly fed up with the emacs style <B>kill-word</B> -
   useless. Came up with a compromise, if no numeric arg is given then it
   works the old way, if an argument is given (i.e. 1, 2 ...) it works in like
   emacs (which makes sense as you are asking it to kill 1 word etc.)</li>
   
   <li>[050708] Changed <B>list-commands</B> and <B>command-apropros</B> to
   not list hidden macros by default. They can be listed if bit 1 of the
   numeric argument is clear (aka <B>list-buffers</B>)</li>
   
   <li>[050625] Updated mode line letter mnemonics which were out of date,
   issue raised by Tom Hundt.</li>
   
   <li>[050625] Stop me crashing when describe-variable is given something
   like &quot;<B>&amp;or</B>&quot;, now restricted to variables of type
   <TT>#</TT>, <TT>$</TT>, <TT>%</TT>, <TT>:</TT>, <TT>.</TT> only.</li>
   
   <li>[050618] Added support for -ve offests to <B>&amp;lef</B>,
   <B>&amp;mid</B>, <B>&amp;rig</B> functions to go from the end of the
   string.</li>
   
   <li>[050618] Created a <I>no wait</I> option to <B>shell-command</B> so
   processes can be launched and forgotten about. Also added support for all
   the other process launch flags present in pipe and ipipe shell commands.
   Removed some very dead code.</li>
   
   <li>[050618] Avoided a '<B>&amp;mid -1</B>' in display matching fence
   (<TT>dmf.emf</TT>) by restructuring the logic a bit.</li>
   
   <li>[050616] Revision 3 of ClearCase support.</li>
   
   <li>[050614] Second rev of clearcase support. restructured the execution
   of cleartool so ipipes are used (even though the user may not be able to
   edit) giving feedback on progress. Implemented a basic diff which can only
   diff one file at a time and only with its predecessor but at least it
   supports a context output of sorts!</li>
   
   <li>[050614] Fixed <B>command-wait</B> when no arg is given to return when
   a callback sets the <TT>.wait</TT> variable. Command now returns
   imediately if the <TT>.wait</TT> variable is not defined. Fixed windows
   sleep function which was managing to break out before it should.</li>
   
   <li>[050612] latex added macros for bold/italic/mono character
   formatting.</li>
   
   <li>[050612] nroff region support for character formating.</li>
   
   <li>[050612] <B>.fhook-xxx.command-n</B> syntax added to
   <B>buffer-init</B> to simplify comamnd definition.</li>
   
   <li>[050610] Removed &quot;<B>C-c C-g</B>&quot; key binding in document
   macros and replaced with &quot;<B>C-c &lt;</B>&quot; because of <B>C-g</B>
   issue.</li>
   
   <li>[050610] CVS added support for a <B>cvsco.etf</B> checkin
   template.</li>
   
   <li>[050610] First revision of ClearCase support, very incomplete and
   primative but the hooks required in the rest of the system are in
   place.</li>
   
   <li>[050609] Changed the directory listing so '<TT>.</TT>' is removed and
   <TT>..</TT> is always the first <I>file</I> and cannot be selected. Fixed
   some directory display annoying refresh issues.</li>
   
   <li>[050609] First implementation of directory deletion, copying and
   moving, including support for ftp directories etc. Areas of concern are
   still copied file's permissions and to a lesser degree ownership. Also the
   copies behaviour with symbolic links, this must be tested further.</li>
   
   <li>[050609] Fixed file permissions and ftp minor issues a couple of major
   ftp bugs and <B>$file-names</B> working for ftp directories.</li>
   
   <li>[050609] Added new <B>&amp;stat</B> &quot;<TT>i</TT>&quot; flag and
   argument bit 4 to <B>file-op</B> to abort on a problem rather than prompt,
   it also returns an error code in <I>$result</I>.</li>
   
   <li>[050609] Changed the kill word commands so have the same word boundary
   behaviour as <B>forward-word</B> and Emacs (was killing word only then
   whitespaces only etc). Corrected word movement and killing command's EOB
   and BOB error handling.</li>
   
   <li>[050608] Added new <B>rdiff</B> (recursive diff) command</li>
   
   <li>[050608] Updated <B>string-rectangle</B> and <B>space-rectangle</B> to
   improve its usability.</li>
   
   <li>[050608] Updated <B>describe-word</B> setup comment.</li>
   
   <li>[050601] Corrected <TT>ne.emf</TT>, broke Window mode in disabling
   console mode for <B>ne&nbsp;-R</B> option change.</li>
   
   <li>[050601] Corrected crash on hilight with alpha-numerics of form
   <TT>[[:digit:]]</TT> when spelt incorrectly.</li>
   
 </ul> 
 
 <h3>8th Release - May 2005</h3>

   versions 20050505.</li>
   
   <li>[050514] Fixed ftp copy lock-up (most noticable on windows) caused by
   the response read at the start of a command also reading (and disgarding)
   the finishing message so ME hangs at the end of the command waiting for a
   response.</li>

   shells.</li>
   
   <li>[050513] Found the UNIX <b>waitpid(-1,...)</b> in the sigchild handler
   (which removes any zoombie processes) removes the pipe commands process so
   the <b>pclose</b> call cannot get the process's exit code (returns
   -1).</li>
   
   <li>[050509] Changed the name of <b>aix43</b> make files to <b>aix4</b>
   and <b>sunos55</b> and <b>sunos56</b> files to a single <b>sunos5</b>
   makefile</li>
   
   <li>[050509] Added support for aix v5 (tested on aix v5.1).</li>

   <li>[050429] Added support for keybinding to item-list column ordering,
   function is <b>item-list-order</b> and is bound to <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>
   and <tt>3</tt> by default. Thanks to Bryan Schofield for his submission in
   this area.</li>
   
   <li>[050429] Spelling - protect '<tt>.</tt>'s in the word with
   <tt>\\</tt>.</li>

   <li>[050427] Major reworking of main commands in a directory listing
   buffer. Implemented typical features found in an OFM standard browser and
   create standard bindings as well as termcap friendly ones. Changed delete
   binding to delete files rather than close browser which is now bound to
   f10.</li>
   
   <li>[050427] osd - Added numeric bit 8 on <b>osd-entry</b> arg to put the
   text above the entry.</li>
   
   <li>[050427] Added <b>C-x&nbsp;k</b> support to browser mode to kill the
   buffer, also added hook for the <b>file-browser</b>'s view file.</li>
   
   <li>[050427] Fixed <b>user-setup</b> to use only one value of
   <b>$file-ignore</b> &amp; $kept-versions per platform rather than one for
   window and one for console based versions.</li>
   
   <li>[050427] Shrunk the size of the file-attrib dialog to ensure it fits
   on a termcap screen.</li>
   
   <li>[050427] Fixed nasty bug with <b>transpose-line</b> at the end of the
   buffer swapping the last line with the first!</li>
   
   <li>[050427] <tt>main.c</tt> - Fixed minor compiler warnings.</li>
   
   <li>[050426] Added a binding for file completion (any key bound to
   <b>insert-tab</b>) so OSD dialogs can do completion (although
   awkwardly).</li>
   
   <li>[050423] Fixed wiki edit mode for Russian keyboards, the '<tt>k</tt>'
   flag key mapping was breaking things.</li>
   
   <li>[050423] Windows - Fixed windows Ctrl numeric pad keys, now come
   through as <b>C-0</b> ... <b>C-9</b>, <b>C-*</b>, <b>C-+</b> etc.</li>
   
   <li>[050420] Added new Dot/Neato support fhook (for <tt>.dot</tt> files) -
   thanks to Detlef for the submission.</li>
   
   <li>[050420] TCL - Added more hilight tokens from Detlef.</li>
   
   <li>[050420] Document macros - fixed cpp-&gt;tcl typo - thanks to Detlef
   for spotting this.</li>
   
   <li>[050410] Fixed the <b>-R</b> option for DOS box, cursor same as the
   foreground color which is not ideal!</li>
   
   <li>[050410] Fixed the SunOS x86 makefile to disabled #pragam warnings
   under GCC.</li>
   
   <li>[050409] Release Candidate 2 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC2)</li>
   
   <li>[050408] Added flag to the <b>user-setup</b> Tools to force the
   rereading of the current buffer's file, thanks to Bryan Schofield.</li>
   
   <li>[050408] Added new <b>.item-list.width</b> variable to allow control
   of the item window list - submitted by Bryan Schofield.</li>
   
   <li>[050408] Moved the generate tags into the sub folder and added a
   compile option to c and cpp - submitted by Bryan Schofield.</li>
   
   <li>[050405] Added support for DOS code page 866 (Cyrillic Russion) -
   submitted by Nicholas Kudriavtsev</li>
   
   <li>[050331] Added support for the setting of the history in macros via
   <b>@h#</b>.</li>
   
   <li>[050325] <tt>registry.c</tt> - removed compiler warning indicating
   porting problem hilighted under Darwin. Post increment of variable on left
   of assignment and same variable appeared on the right, split out the
   increment to reduce ambiguity of the statement.</li>
   
   <li>[050320] UNIX only - add a rule for <tt>.dir</tt> files found in the
   X11 directory. We do not want this files identified as "<tt>dir</tt>" info
   root file</li>
   
   <li>[050320] Added termcap (white) scheme for reverse video
   operation.</li>
   
   <li>[050320] Newuser registry file - added default entry for Apple Mac
   "<i>darwin</i>". Confirmed operation under Mac X-Windows.</li>
   
   <li>[050320] Extended ME exit commands to support the discarding of
   modified buffers '<tt>0x8</tt> discard modified buffers' and
   '<tt>0x10</tt> discard modified buffers and create recovery file for
   changes'.</li>
   
   <li>[050320] Corrected XML syntax for strings "<tt>...</tt>" to fix indent
   and hilight anomalies.</li>
   
   <li>[050319] Added <b>-R</b> command line option to reverse the built in
   video schemes - specifically for <b>ne(1)</b> also works with
   <b>me(1)</b>.</li>
   
   <li>[050319] Corrected default mode settings. Recent removal of
   <b>letter(2m)</b>, <b>line(2m)</b> etc. changed the mode byte assignment
   of some modes. The built in global mode default was not updated for this
   change in bytes and incorrect global modes appeared as a result -
   specifically <b>quiet(2m)</b> which has jumped bytes.</li>
   
   <li>[050315] LEX/YACC template - Corrected LEX and YACC highlighting.
   Aligned C, C++ and YACC/LEX templates to be consistent.</li>
   
   <li>[050315] C/C++ templates - buffer setup modified for GNU Indent Style
   setting.</li>
   
   <li>[050315] Added new <b>browse(3)</b> command and binding to <b>f3</b>,
   changed existing <b>collapse-all</b> <b>f3</b> binding to
   <b>C-f2</b>.</li>
   
   <li>[050315] Modified ME exit commands to support a bitwise arg <i>n</i>
   where main <b>exit-emacs</b> has '<tt>0x01 Prompt</tt>', '<tt>0x02 Save
   each buffer/reg/dic (with prompt if 0x01 set)</tt>' and '<tt>0x04 Prompt
   for exit code and exit ME with that code.</tt>'</li>
   
   <li>[050313] Latex template - Corrected the <b>latex-fill-paragraph</b>.
   Set the fill-mode to '<b>l</b>' rather than '<b>L</b>' because its a pain
   when it selects centre rather than left and messes things up.</li>
   
   <li>[050311] Directory list - changed column sorting so <i>Modified</i> is
   sorted most recent first.</li>
   
   <li>[050311] Fixed <b>perldb</b> pipe operation.</li>
   
   <li>[050310] OSD simplified the main context menu and moved paste a cvs
   items in the directory context menu</li>
   
   <li>[050310] Fixed diff's file name input, was not completing
   correctly</li>
   
   <li>[050310] CVS changed the default setting of the recursive add to
   off.</li>
   
   <li>[050310] JASSPA MicroEmacs quick start document released.</li>
   
   <li>[050309] Fixed bug in regex multi-line search backwards, searching for
   "<tt>foo[^a]</tt>" is a mult-line as <tt>[^a]</tt> matches <tt>\\n</tt>,
   if "<b>foob</b>" exists at the start of the line <b>isearch-backward</b>
   refuses to move on.</li>
   
   <li>[050309] Catman pages added for <b>ne(1)</b> and <b>me(1)</b>
   complaints with gentoo as missing. Added to the package builds.</li>
   
   <li>[050308] Fixed a nasty bug with ftp connect dialog when the host has a
   port. Changed the default path to be nothing which becomes <b>/~/</b> to
   list the login directory. Change the tab order to not include the password
   as tabbing through the entry will lose the password, must now access via
   mouse or hot key which is not ideal.</li>
   
   <li>[050308] Added support for relative ftp browsing via new
   <b>ftp://???/~/???</b> url form. Added file name completion support for
   <b>ftp</b></li>
   
   <li>[050306] Corrected the docmacro <b>http://</b>ling regular
   expression.</li>
   
   <li>[050306] Changed the date format of the -V command line option to
   include the century, same format as the about(2) buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[050302] HTLP and PHP - fixed indent problems.</li>
   
   <li>[050302] Perl template - fixed indent problems caused by not skipping
   the <b>=~</b> type regex's</li>
   
   <li>[050302] TCL template - fixed continuation and comment indent
   bug.</li>
   
   <li>[050302] Added support for R/S-plus (.r) files - thanks to
   Detlef.</li>
   
   <li>[050225] HTML template - fixed an indent which was fixed at
   "<tt>2</tt>" rather than "<tt>t</tt>" and added comment skipping indent
   rules</li>
   
   <li>[050225] <b>dos2unix</b>, <b>unix2dos</b> and <b>unix2win</b> -
   Removed use of <b>&amp;spr</b> in favor of <b>&amp;cat</b> so
   <b>dos2unix</b> etc work in ne.</li>
   
   <li>[050225] Tracing a problem with hilighting a token of the form
   "<tt>AB*$</tt>", works if there is a <b>B</b> but fails if there are no
   '<b>B</b>'s, i.e. only matches "<tt>AB+$</tt>". Found that removing the
   end of line special case code fixes the problem. I believe the rest of the
   code has been improved to handle any end-of-line quirks - I hope so!</li>
   
   <li>[050225] Removed the '<b>start-up</b>' macro function compile option
   so all versions support this - <b>ne</b> can now do a
   "<b>@dos2unix</b>"</li>
   
   <li>[050225] Regular expressions - extended replacement string syntax.
   Added support for "<b>\c#</b>" "<b>\l#</b>" and "<b>\u#</b>" to change the
   case of groups, where "<b>\c#</b>" is capitalise, "<b>\l#</b>" is lower
   "<b>\u#</b>" is upper and "<b>#</b>" is the group number (<b>0-9</b>,
   <b>&amp;</b>)</li>
   
   <li>[050225] Regular expressions - changed syntax of "<b>\s?</b>" and
   "<b>\S?</b>" in favor of perl's simpler "<b>\s</b>" and "<b>\S</b>" for a
   whitespace char class. Added new character classes "<b>\d</b>" = digits,
   "<b>\D</b>" != digits "<b>\h</b>" = hexdigits "<b>\H</b>" != hexdigits
   "<b>\l</b>" = lowercase "<b>\L</b>" != lowercase "<b>\u</b>" = uppercase
   and "<b>\U</b>" != uppercase. These changes were made to both the main
   regex search engine and the <b>hilight(2)</b> token matching engine. Added
   support for char classes within the main regex <b>[...]</b> character
   class, i.e. now supports regexs like "<b>[\l\u_]</b>" for any lower, upper
   or '<b>_</b>' char. This is not supported in the hilight which currently
   has a more simplistic "<b>[...]</b>" char class support.</li>
   
   <li>[050225] Regular expressions - changed use of "<b>\s&nbsp;</b>",
   "<b>\s-</b>", "<b>\S&nbsp;</b>" and "<b>\S-</b>" classes to simply
   "<b>\s</b>" and "<b>\S</b>" which is perl regex compliant (ditching Emacs
   "<b>\s</b>" syntax as it is cumbersome and not very useful). The only
   nasty side effect is hilight's miss-use of "\<b>S1</b>" - "<b>\S9</b>" to
   mean not "<b>\1</b>" - "<b>\9</b>" group char, changed to "<b>\!1</b>" -
   "<b>\!9</b>"</li>
   
   <li>[050224] NE set to not auto-save or create backups by default.</li>
   
   <li>[050224] Added "<b>-a</b>" and "<b>-B</b>" command line options to
   enable and disable auto-save and backup modes.</li>
   
   <li>[050224] Tcl template - some more fixes to the item list from
   Detlef</li>
   
   <li>[050224] watch - improved the refresh rate of a type 2 or 3 watch by
   ignoring the <b>:watch time</b> and just look at the <b>:watch-size</b>.
   Fixed the split line issue with type 2 of 3 watching caused by last line
   not being complete.</li>
   
   <li>[050224] <b>M-x ftp</b> - stripped '<i>ftp://</i>' and any trailing
   '<i>/</i>' of the users entered host name as these break ftp. Improved the
   dialog's handling of passwords, the user can now tell if a password has
   been set.</li>
   
   <li>[050224] Added standard binding for mark-function</li>
   
   <li>[050224] Fixed the ME token hilighting in the C hook</li>
   
   <li>[050224] Removed recently added <b>%no_backup</b> variable to disable
   backup create as new <b>-B</b> option is a much better way of doing
   it.</li>
   
   <li>[050224] edef.h - Removed definition of non-existant variable</li>
   
   <li>[050224] Fixed failure when trying to load
   "<b>http://www.jasspa.com</b>", there is an implicit trailing '<b>/</b>'
   which MicroEmacs now adds.</li>
   
   <li>[050224] Tcl template - major improvement - courtesy of Detlef.</li>
   
   <li>[050224] Fixed collapse to support the file hooks <b>.exact</b>
   setting (set to -1 means case insensitive)</li>
   
   <li>[050224] Added new <b>beginning-of-function</b>,
   <b>end-of-function</b>, <b>goto-function-line</b> and <b>mark-function</b>
   macros - thanks to Detlef.</li>
   
   <li>[050223] Windows MS-dev 6 project - corrected project settings for
   <tt>_URLSUPP</tt> =&gre; <tt>_SOCKET</tt> in keeping with the socket
   dynamic library loading.</li>
   
   <li>[050223] Added exec of wish to the tcl magic hook</li>
   
   <li>[050223] Fixed <b>$window-chars</b> - added OSD default button
   chars.</li>
   
   <li>[050222] Fixed $user-path being more that 35 chars breaking the
   user-setup dialog.</li>
   
   <li>[050222] Directory listing - call fhook-html when file is a
   <b>http://</b> file - this is never a directory listing.</li>
   
   <li>[050222] Stopped loading of files in dir listing when clicking way to
   the right, must click on the name (ME kept loading files when just trying
   to raise the window to the front - annoying).</li>
   
   <li>[050222] If 0 given to watch call <b>watch-time</b>, this preserves
   the old interface.</li>
   
   <li>[050222] Added backup file disabling for "<b>dos2unix</b>" macros via
   command line defineable variable.</li>
   
   <li>[050221] Changed the new Windows process tree killing to use
   LoadLibrary() to detect whether the OS supports this feature (and NT does
   not). Also moved the URL support over to LoadLibrary() so we can remove
   the <b>-u</b> builds.</li>
   
   <li>[050220] Added UNIX Shell and Makefile hilighting to
   <b>notes(2)</b>.</li>
   
   <li>[050219] Fixed GNU GCC warnings in Makefiles for #pragma in X11 files
   under Sun Solaris and uninitialized variables.</li>
   
   <li>[050219] OSD. Removed dialog '<tt>F</tt>' flag as it was not
   documented, did not work and only used in one obscure place. Fixed
   <b>C-g</b> &amp; <b>Del</b> so they close up to the previous dialog but
   does close the main menu down in one call - was annoying.</li>
   
   <li>[050219] Release Candidate 1 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC1)</li>
   
   <li>[050218] Corrected UNIX client-server socket file check -- bad test on
   existence of connection file, using wrong variable with wrong test
   sense.</li>
   
   <li>[050218] Added site delete button to ftp-connect dialog.</li>
   
   <li>[050218] Fixed abbreviation and exec-string "<tt>\\p</tt>" and
   "<tt>\\P</tt>" store and goto position problem when the <b>C-x C-a</b> or
   <b>C-x a</b> keys are rebound. Fixed by replacing with '<tt>esc x
   set-alpha-mark P</tt>' (where <b>esc x</b> is a safe internal special
   key).</li>
   
   <li>[050218] Updated <b>watch</b> interface and made public. Created new
   <b>watch-time</b> command and prompt user for watch type when no argument
   is given.</li>
   
   <li>[050218] Removed the use of bit <tt>0x1000</tt> in ada string
   <b>hilight</b> as this is unlikely to be wanted (probably copied from
   Pascal).</li>
   
   <li>[050218] Changed the registry parser to abort on error rather than
   trying to carry on (a very painful process for a badly decrypted reg
   file)</li>
   
   <li>[050218] Fixed highlighting minor issues. Hilight scheme now returns
   back to <tt>EOL</tt> scheme after a bracket. A branch tag on an
   <tt>EOL</tt> line removes the <tt>EOL</tt> flag so it hilights correctly.
   Branch tag now supports the <tt>0x1000</tt> single line hilight. Lookback
   now supports <tt>0x800</tt> on a branch tag.</li>
   
   <li>[050217] HTML highlighting. Fixed some really grizzly scripted html
   page highlighting issues, predominantly with php.</li>
   
   <li>[050217] Change ftp so it opens the <b>ftp-connect</b> dialog if the
   current buffer is <tt>*ftp-files*</tt>.</li>
   
   <li>[050217] Fixed ftp dir list column detection and highlighting issue
   with windows ftp servers (time given as 9:15 not 09:15)</li>
   
   <li>[050217] Fixed bug in <b>set-variable</b> and <b>unset-variable</b>
   when <b>&amp;spr</b> is used to create a variable name.</li>
   
   <li>[050217] Watch command (<tt>watch.emf</tt>). Improved the watch
   command, made '<b>0 watch</b>' call <b>watch-reset</b>, changed
   watch-reset so with an argument of 0 it removes all watches otherwise it
   resets the main watch counter and reports to the user which buffers are
   watched. Added new '<b>2 watch</b>' &amp; '<b>3 watch</b>' which compares
   the file size, doing the following:
   
   <ul>
     
     <li>file on disk is smaller than last watch - reloads whole file</li>
     
     <li>file size is the same - does nothing</li>
     
     <li>file on disk is larger - appends to the end of the buffer the tail
     of the file (file_size - watch_file_size bytes)</li>
     
   </ul>
   
   This assumes that the files is always being appended (reasonable
   assumption in most cases. The only difference between 2 and 3 is that 2
   forces a complete reread of the file on the first file change (ensuring
   the buffer is correct), 3 does not which allows the user to trash the
   first gigabyte of the buffer before starting the watch.</li>
   
   <li>[050217] Shell template - added local and function keywords and fixed
   a few string highlighting problems.</li>
   
   <li>[050216] Made the dir-listing's (Filtered) label on line 2 pickable,
   changing the filter status when picked Made CVS's CVS-Quick label pickable
   doing a full reread when picked.</li>
   
   <li>[050216] Fixed a couple of silly register bugs introduced with last
   find-reg concatenate root and sub-key change. Improved behavior when ftp
   erf file is missing, now create a new one in memory and flags as changed
   so should be saved on exit.</li>
   
   <li>[050216] Do not abort me.emf execution if ftp erf file is missing or
   bad.</li>
   
   <li>[050216] Fixed by removing the 'startup' function, the main init now
   uses dofile directly and it checks for either a <tt>NULL</tt> or
   <tt>""</tt> as a filname and replaces with "<b>me</b>" or ("<b>ne</b>" and
   does not complain) if found to be empty. This means that give execute-file
   an empty string executes either "<b>me</b>" or "<b>ne</b>", i.e. resets me
   - nice side effect. Changed '<b>dofile()</b>' to <b>execFile()</b> and
   changed <b>execFile()</b> to <b>executeFile()</b> (as is function for
   command execute-file) and change the other exec command function names for
   consistency.</li>
   
   <li>[050216] Fixed an annoyance reported by Bruno, ne should not complain
   if it fails to find <tt>ne.emf</tt> - fair enough.</li>
   
   <li>[050215] Fixed crash caused by using <b>-c</b> option with all files
   hidden (comment when browsing ftp dirs as cache dir lists are hidden) The
   startup process knows the history created buffers but the replacement was
   none of these and due to the tool-bar it was a buffer without a file name
   and bang! Fixed in 2 ways, first check the replacement has a file name,
   second do not put hidden files into the history - they're hidden.</li>
   
   <li>[050210] Improved movement between items using the cursor in the
   search dialog.</li>
   
   <li>[050210] Fixed cvs dialog default settings</li>
   
   <li>[050210] Corrected search path expansion, incorrectly handling a
   <tt>PATH_CHAR</tt> at the start of the string.</li>
   
   <li>[050209] Up-dated user-setup platform page to new style and added yank
   rectangle binding.</li>
   
   <li>[050209] Fixed no-color termcap <b>$window-char</b> variable
   setting</li>
   
   <li>[050209] Fixed hot keys (were 3 'U's) in osdmisc.emf</li>
   
   <li>[050209] Added new BraceStatement indent value to support GNU C
   indentation style.</li>
   
   <li>[050209] Fixed the osdDisp() function required a TTflush otherwise the
   cursor is left in the wrong position on termcap systems.</li>
   
   <li>[050209] Fixed the default <b>$window-char</b> variable setting.</li>
   
   <li>[050209] Fixed the DOS home directory setting and compiler
   warnings.</li>
   
   <li>[050208] Changed the C indent definition to be the same format as the
   existing indent definitions i.e. uses flag &amp; indent value, this makes
   it more flexible and extendible. Updated macro files.</li>
   
   <li>[050205] Password generation macros added to contrib directory.</li>
   
   <li>[050205] Added JavaDoc highlighting to Java template. Enablement via
   buffer-setup. Removed the existing "<b>my</b>" extensions from
   contrib.</li>
   
   <li>[050205] Added Doxygen, &lt;stdint.h&gt; and error highlighting to
   C/C++ templates. Enablement via buffer-setup. Removed the existing
   "<b>my</b>" extensions from contrib.</li>
   
   <li>[050204] osd - Fixed problems with the '<i>cursor shows current
   item</i>' feature of osd caused by the cursor position going outside of
   the window.</li>
   
   <li>[050202] Added an initial item number to the favorite and buffer
   menus.</li>
   
   <li>[050203] Standardized narrow anchor and line flag movement behaviors
   with respect to deleting and inserting text. Enforced to effectively exist
   at character column -1 and been strict about maintaining a protected line.
   Made undo cope with markup lines that are lost. These changes may be a
   little to severe - we'll see.</li>
   
   <li>[050202] Fixed <tt>C-g</tt> close osd dialog crash.</li>
   
   <li>[050202] Directory listing - fixed nasty bug cause by the directory
   changing on disk before the hook has managed to do anything leading to a
   failure - this has been annoying Jon for some time!</li>
   
   <li>[050127] <tt>hkemf.emf</tt> - Fixed <b>!until</b> indent rule</li>
   
   <li>[050127] First revision of "<b>notes</b>".</li>
   
   <li>[050127] Fixed positional problems with mouse rectangle regions and
   added a mouse rectangle yank to user-setup.</li>
   
   <li>[050127] CVS - Set the initial osd dialog item to be the first item
   rather than the Okay button (with is still the default button).</li>
   
   <li>[050127] Fixed <b>*scratch*</b> hook assignment issues, initial
   startup buffer and only buffer delete problem.</li>
   
   <li>[050127] Added process tree killing for windows, tested on win98, 2k
   &amp; XP, would be good to test on win95 (which should work) and NT which
   should not work but hopefully will be no worse than current version.<br/>
   This is a process tree killing for ipipes, in win32 killing the process we
   create is simply not good enough, all child processes continue unaffected.
   For example, run compile, kill the buffer in mid compile and it carries on
   behind your back!<br/> For Unix we use a new group and kill the group, DOS
   does not support ipipe. We could have used the new Job concept in ME but
   this is only present in win2000 &amp; XP and the binaries are unlikely to
   run on win98 etc. This should run on every win32 platform although it is
   unlikely to do anything positive on an NT box (works in win2k)</li>
   
   <li>[050126] Changed the location of the fhook-default macro so its only
   defined if using buffinit (i.e. if running main me.emf)</li>
   
   <li>[050126] Fixed osd button repeat issue when current focus is an
   entry.</li>
   
   <li>[050126] Changed "<b>insert-file-name</b>" to insert buffer name if a
   -ve arg is given, bound to C-x y, this replaces ml-lines esc y
   feature.</li>
   
   <li>[050123] Fixed a crash caused by too many closed fences, the recursive
   nature of the findfence() function triggers a stack crash at around 22000
   on windows. Set limit to 256 nested fences.</li>
   
   <li>[050122] Fixed "<b>dir</b>" mode loss on a directory re-read, this
   caused a number of side effects including loss of highlighting and user
   prompt to reload the directory when it had changed.</li>
   
   <li>[050119] Removed the "<b>sub-key</b>" argument from all registry
   related calls ("<b>&amp;reg</b>" and "<b>set-registry</b>"). The registry
   calls used to comprise two arguments "<b>root</b>" and "<b>sub-key</b>",
   the "<b>sub-key</b>" is really redundant and the same effect may be
   achieved by a simple string concatenation of the "<b>sub-key</b>" to the
   "<b>root</b>".</li>
   
   <li>[050119] Added "<b>my-*hook-always</b>" macro checks in the buffer
   hook switching to permit global file hooks to be defined, this allows a
   file hook to operate on all buffers. "<b>my-*hook-always</b>" is executed
   after the language file hooks of "<b>*hook-XXX</b>" and
   "<b>my-*hook-XXX</b>".</li>
   
   <li>[050116] Added "<b>TODO</b>" highlighting rule for Makefile
   comments.</li>
   
   <li>[050114] Fixed <b>narrow(2)</b> type numeric argument not processed
   correctly.</li>
   
   <li>[050113] Added toolbar tool mouse select region command.</li>
   
   <li>[050113] Added bindings for the cvs and ftp console tools.</li>
   
   <li>[050113] Fixed <b>organizer(3)</b> duplicate index bug.</li>
   
   <li>[050111] Deleted the <b>get-registry(2)</b> command, this has been
   depreciated and <b>&amp;reg</b> should be used instead.</li>
   
   <li>[050111] Extended the <b>read-registry(2)</b> and
   <b>save-registry(2)</b> commands to permit reading and writing from a
   buffer based registry (rather than file).</li>
   
   <li>[050111] Extended <b>list-registry(2)</b> to permit listing of
   specific nodes, the output buffer of the registry listing may be
   specified. Added a invisible flag to a registry node which hides the node
   completely (but can be toggled).</li>
   
   <li>[050111] Fixed windows server cmd file polling of up to 60 times a
   second by making the adder of the command responsible for 'waking' ME by
   sending a WM_USER message. This is not a problem for UNIX as it is
   possible to wait on file input and EOF is not reported.</li>
   
   <li>[050105] Fixed several narrow-to usability issues, with these fixes
   the top and bottom narrow cannot be removed without a markup line and the
   order cannot get muddled.</li>
   
   <li>[050105] Fixed a problem with the anchor position up-date when
   inserting a whole line.</li>
   
   <li>[050105] Changed the osd entry mouse handling to always refocus, this
   allows the user to change location in the current entry using the
   mouse.</li>
   
   <li>[050105] Fixed. insert-macro undo location was incorrect causing a
   crash.</li>
   
   <li>[050103] Spelling dialog. Changed the Ignore button to Continue if
   word becomes correct without changing (word added or language
   changed).</li>
   
   <li>[050103] Fixed. CVS osd dialog with bad hot-key.</li>
   
   <li>[050102] Added setting of <b>$recent-keys</b> variable.</li>
   
   <li>[041231] Variable "<b>$fmatchdelay</b>" renamed to
   "<b>$pause-time</b>". The "<b>$pause-time</b>" is now used for other
   MicroEmacs delay times when the user is prompted for information.</li>
   
   <li>[041224] Fixed several usability issues in the search replace
   dialog.</li>
   
   <li>[041224] Up-graded printer-setup dialog to new style OSD.</li>
   
   <li>[041224] CVS dialog - added read-only option to checkout and
   update.</li>
   
   <li>[041224] Fixed goto-line offset which as always going to the previous
   line (one out).</li>
   
   <li>[041221] Added support for proper kill buffer use in message line,
   i.e. set-mark, kill-region, copy-region, yank and reyank all work in the
   same way as a normal buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[041221] Fixed registry node deletion when the node is modified.</li>
   
   <li>[041221] Removed osd 0 'd' flag and added 'I' initial item and 'D'
   default button flags, existing osd dialogs which use 'd' will fail to load
   and need are migrated to use the D and I flags.</li>
   
   <li>[041218] auto-spell key bindings are promoted to global so its easy to
   enable in any buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[041218] Corrected setting of the $home environment variable to handle
   MS-Windows '\\'s, auto terminate with '/'.</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Added Enable/Disable Auto-Spell to the context menu.</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Rearranged the organizer dialog to be a little easier to
   navigate through.</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Fixed nedit emulation insert binding.</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Removed "<b>ml-clear</b>" command, replaced with "<b>0
   ml-write</b>".</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Removed the change-directory commands, a change in directory
   is achieved by changing the "<b>$buffer-fname</b>" value such that the
   path defines the location of the command. All macros operated relative to
   the buffer location and never explicitly changed the directory
   location.</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Fixed CUA emulation insert binding.</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Deleted letter(2m) mode. Use the default binding of
   "<b>forward-delete-char</b>" for letter mode off, where single deleted
   characters are to be added to the kill buffer then the existing letter(2m)
   mode may be achieved by binding as "<b>1 forward-delete-char</b>".
   Similarly for backspace, "<b>backward-delete-char</b>".</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Deleted line(2m) mode. Use a binding of "<b>1 kill-line</b>"
   to mimic the line(2m) mode enabled and "<b>kill-line</b>" for line(2m)
   mode disabled.</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Deleted cmode(2m). Electric-c is now configured with
   indent(2). C and C++ indent styles can be different, can also have a GNU C
   style etc, can change the indent width as new indent rule supports 't',
   consistent $buffer-indent interface.</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Created new osd file "<b>osdmisc.emf</b>" for miscellaneous
   OSD macros, this removes the OSD dependency when the MicroEmacs is
   executed in special start up modes with startup files. Moved search and
   new indent-setup commands out of "<b>search.emf</b>" and
   "<b>format.emf</b>" into a new "<b>osdmisc.emf</b>" as they cause problems
   with utils that do not run "<b>me.emf</b>" (e.g.
   "<b>ehftools.emf</b>")</li>
   
   <li>[041210] Introduced a GNU emacs emulation mode, emulation file is
   "<b>meemacs.emf</b>".</li>
   
   <li>[041209] Fixed newuser "<b>$user-name.emf</b>" conflict issue with an
   existing macro (e.g. zaurus.emf) by testing for it and prefixing a digit
   to make the file unique.</li>
   
   <li>[041209] Added esc C-\\ binding to restyle-buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[041209] Fixed some issues with the Tools user-setup dialog.</li>
   
   <li>[041128] Added MinGW makefile posted to JASSPA group, forms part of
   the release makefiles.</li>
   
   <li>[041126] Added 'k' keyboard setup to set-char-mask which is used to
   translates foreign keys to a latin char.</li>
   
   <li>[041126] Changed the internal LEADER byte to 0x1c as 0xff is a valid
   Russian char and it badly breaks $vars and macros.</li>
   
   <li>[041126] Fixed spell dump word which was not translating the words to
   the users char-set.</li>
   
   <li>[041126] Added support for Russian language.</li>
   
   <li>[041126] Improved the aff ispell conversion routines (almost works
   automatically).</li>
   
   <li>[041126] Stopped auto-spell from triggering the no dictionaries error,
   leave it to spell-buffer etc.</li>
   
   <li>[041125] Fixed OSD multi-line C-k kill-line behavior and implemented
   <b>-1 kill-line</b> support.</li>
   
   <li>[041125] Added basic support for Verilog programming language.</li>
   
   <li>[041123] Fixed ftp OSD (auto entering entries broke the password
   field) and modernized.</li>
   
   <li>[041028] Fixed. <b>*find*</b> buffer exhibits the same behavior as
   <b>*grep*</b> buffer. i.e. the <b>*find*</b> buffer remains on screen and
   a pop-up window is used to show the file.</li>
   
   <li>[041028] Fixed. *grep* buffer does not load file when selected with
   &lt;RETURN&gt;.</li>
   
   <li>[041027] Spruced up old "<b>apache.conf</b>" highlighting rules and
   added to release.</li>
   
   <li>[041022] Fixed very obscure cvs load-up bug.</li>
   
   <li>[041122] Updated schemes to set 'Show cursor in osd' suitably and to
   make sure the cursor is not red as this conflicts with the match fence
   display.</li>
   
   <li>[041120] Fixed transpose-line crash when undo mode is disabled.</li>
   
   <li>[041120] Removed the OSD explicit tab order value as this was not
   constructively used and causes many item order problems.</li>
   
   <li>[041119] Many improvements to OSD dialog user interface following
   suggestions for news group. Updated most of the osd dialogs to use the new
   [*] checkbox chars. Fixed tabbing orders and moved some items over to
   combo-boxes. Added osd-cursor visibility support to scheme-edit. Made the
   displaying of the cursor in an osd dialog a $system bit set by the hilight
   scheme and fixed the position when in a child dialog.</li>
   
   <li>[041118] Added a macro recursion depth limit of 20 to avoid blowing up
   ME when the user has created an infinitely recursive macro.</li>
   
   <li>[041112] Added Paul Boekholt's suggested GNU Emacs key bindings.</li>
   
   <li>[041107] kill-paragraph, fill-paragraph, forward-paragraph and
   backward-paragraph commands redefined. kill-paragraph now kills forward
   and backward rather than control the kill buffer. Paragraph movement now
   defined blank-line to blank-line rather than the first/last paragraph
   line.</li>
   
   <li>[041105] Fixed kill-lines and kill-word numerical argument
   implementation.</li>
   
   <li>[041104] Removed "<b>regex-forward</b>" and "<b>regex-backward</b>"
   macros and moved uses of them over to search-buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[041104] Added "<b>search-buffer</b>" command which replaces the macro
   commands "<b>regex-forward</b>" and "<b>regex-backward</b>". Simplifies
   macro processing of searching by providing a search that explicitly sets
   the "<b>exact</b>" and "<b>magic</b>" modes. The default is to repect
   buffers exact and magic mode and flags must have E or M to ensure they are
   disabled.</li>
   
   <li>[041104] Changed any use of "<b>kill-line</b>" to "<b>1 kill-line</b>"
   as this should maintain its required behavior. A "<b>kill-line</b>" with
   no numeric argument kills to the end of the line but excludes the end of
   line character (GNU Emacs compatibility). The default binding is the "<b>1
   kill-line</b>" form, re-bind the key to "<b>kill-line</b>" if the end of
   line is not to be killed.</li>
   
   <li>[041104] Removed line and letter buffer modes as these can be done
   using numerical arguments to bindings. See the the "<b>kill-line</b>"
   binding which replaces line mode. See "<b>forward-delete-char</b>" and
   "<b>backward-delete-char</b>" binding which replaces letter mode.</li>
   
   <li>[041104] Changed the "<b>kill-word</b>" commands to be more consistent
   with GNU Emacs.</li>
   
   <li>[041102] Moved winterm over to using addKeyToBufferOnce() for mouse
   move and time, also done same for UNIX mouse time event. This minimizes
   the number of mouse moved events that are processed by the system.</li>
   
   <li>[041101] MS Windows. Fixed mouse cursor disappearing after using a
   Shift or Control mouse button event.</li>
   
   <li>[041101] Auto reload the directory even if it is changed
   (hkdirlst.emf).</li>
   
   <li>[041030] MS-Windows. Removed the "<b>WM_INPUTLANGCHANGE</b>" message
   handler as this did the wrong thing (use Alt-Shift to change between 2
   different keyboards e.g. US and Russian)</li>
   
   <li>[041030] MS-Windows. Changed the method used to get the APPDATA path
   to use SHGetSpecialFolderLocation() as this is available in all versions
   of Windows.</li>
   
   <li>[041030] UNIX. Fixed the mouse movement which caused a rendering
   anomaly. Mouse moved commands are only added to the key buffer if the key
   is not already present in the key queue. This alleviates a large build up
   of redundant mouse move keys on the queue. (Added function
   addKeyToBufferOnce())</li>
   
   <li>[041030] Added mouse rectangle region selection methods,
   copy-rectangle and kill-rectangle.</li>
   
   <li>[041029] Hardened C++ commenting on // alignment when the previous
   line is a solid ////////// when re-styling buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[041029] Fixed "<b>*find*</b>" buffer operation so that it operates
   like *grep* on file selection. Keyboard file section enabled within the
   "<b>*grep*</b>" and "<b>*find*</b>" buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[041029] Added Apache configuration file highlighting rules.</li>
   
   <li>[041026] Spruced up old "<b>smb.conf</b>" highlighting rules, brought
   them up to date with latest keywords and added to release.</li>
   
   <li>[041026] Fixed indent-setup osd dialog.</li>
   
   <li>[041024] Macro/source compatibility macro and source versions updated
   to "<b>20041001</b>".</li>
   
   <li>[041024] Fixed the cvs-diff options, local with HEAD was not
   correct.</li>
   
   <li>[041024] Latex template extended. Buffer bindings for underscore and
   quote keys. Search tools to determine current context.</li>
   
   <li>[041023] Extended the buffer setup for the indent mechanism. May now
   specify the default buffer indent-width and tab-size in the buffer setup
   dialog.</li>
   
   <li>[041022] Revised indentation implementation. The templates now define
   indent width independent rules. The indent commend 'indent' parameter may
   be defined as an absolute indentation or using a 't' notation. The syntax
   is "<b>[-][[indent][/indent]]t</b>" which defines a vulgar fration of 't'
   which is the indent width (or tabsize) as specified by
   "<b>$buffer-indent-width</b>" defined below.<br/>
   
   The global variables "<b>$tabsize</b>" renamed "<b>$indent-width</b>" and
   controls the global indentation size. "<b>$tabwidth</b>" renamed
   "<b>$tab-width</b>" and controls the display size of a literal TAB
   character.<br/>
   
   The indentation is now specified on a buffer basis, the variables
   "<b>$buffer-indent-width</b>" and "<b>$buffer-tab-width</b>" define the
   indentation and TAB width on a per buffer basis. These are seeded from the
   aforementioned global variables.</li>
   
   <li>[041022] Fixed spelling mistake in user interface of XML macros.</li>
   
   <li>[041022] Removed CVS "<b>Log:</b>" field from all of the template
   files - undesirable.</li>
   
   <li>[041022] Added HTTP highlighting to the text document template.</li>
   
   <li>[041021] Enhanced Wiki language template.</li>
   
   <li>[041021] Added Windows CUA emulation mode.</li>
   
   <li>[041019] Fixed insert binding for Nedit emulation mode</li>
   
   <li>[041019] Fixed perl highlighting rules. Using incorrect syntax.</li>
   
   <li>[041016] Fixed UNIX make files for building NE in debug mode.</li>
   
   <li>[041016] Fixed termcap entry for ^@ key (C-space). (Thanks to Bob
   Paddock for noting ommission)</li>
   
   <li>[041016] Added M-% binding to query-replace as built in binding.
   (Thanks to Bob Paddock)</li>
   
   <li>[041016] Added Ruby programming language support.</li>
   
   <li>[041015] Corrected problem with directory listing loosing highlighting
   (@mna problem).</li>
   
   <li>[041014] Within OSD, fixed spelling mistake. Loose -&gt; Lose</li>
   
   <li>[041014] Fixed delete-hilight-lines failure when buffer file has
   changed.</li>
   
   <li>[041009] Fixed osd entry scheme as the cursor was not visible in MS
   Dev-Studio Colors.</li>
   
   <li>[041009] Added Wiki language template</li>
   
   <li>[041003] Wheel mouse binding added as default.</li>
   
   <li>[041003] Catch long lines from cut and paste, resolve crash.</li>
   
   <li>[041002] Added X-Windows drag and drop support using xdnd.</li>
   
   <li>[040930] Added HTML, XML and SGML close bracket auto expansion.</li>
   
   <li>[040930] Added XML and HTML verification macro. Added XML utilities
   macros to allow next and previous tag to be matched. The XML utilities are
   also used by SGML.</li>
   
   <li>[040930] Added xxxx-pre-expand-abbrev hook so that macros may add
   their own expansion methods.</li>
   
   <li>[040917] Added &lt;...&gt; as supported fences.</li>
   
   <li>[040917] Fixed the -1 add-next-line ignore line feature.</li>
   
   <li>[040915] cvs-add looks for a Tags file in the CVS directory and sets
   the GUI state appropriately. Added server to the cvs-state line
   mangling.</li>
   
   <li>[040909] cvs GUI updated with new features. Added repository set up to
   the UI. Reduced wait time on long commands by using ipipe. Allowed -z
   option to be used with %cvs-com.</li>
   
   <li>[040828] About page includes the century in the date (suggested by
   -Th)</li>
   
   <li>[040824] Fix for man page hyper-link when includes -/./_
   characters.</li>
   
   <li>[040814] Linux manual page formatting fixes.</li>
   
 </ul>

   <li>[040728] Corrected Linux kernel 2.6 pty allocation.</li>
   
   <li>[040630] Linux manual page formatting fixes.</li>
   
   <li>[040518] Comment definition corrections for C, C++ and java, notable
   doxygen comment formation omitted.</li>
   
   <li>[040518] Corrected block comment formatting, adding an extra space at
   the end of the comment.</li>
   
 </ul>
 
 <h3>7th Release - March 2004</h3>
 <ul>

   calls otherwise the modified short name is returned. DJGPPv1 is still
   supported original definitions maintained.</li>
   
   <li>[040326] Added <b>filetype</b> macro to determine the file type of
   MS-DOS, Windows or UNIX.</li>
   
   <li>[040322] <b>$mouse</b> variables configured under console modes to
   allow pseudo mouse operations to be performed.</li>

   was not supported under win32s through incorrect configuration
   definition.</li>
   
   <li>[040322] Key bindings for the file browser. <tt>ENTER</tt> now handled
   on the reserved fields to sort. <tt>BACKSPACE</tt> now moves up a
   directory level.</li>
   
   <li>[040322] Changed the interface to cvs, ftp and file-browser command so
   that if a numeric argument of 0 is given then the directory tree window is
   not opened, just the <b>*files*</b> buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[040322] AutoIt hook. Thanks to Dr Detlef Groth.</li>

   <li>[040310] Fix to graphical diff (<b>gdiff</b>). Occasions where all
   changes had been accepted and the changes could not be saved. <b>gdiff</b>
   incorrectly prompted user to accept all changes first.</li>
   
   <li>[040310] Support for multiple comment styles in the same language
   template. Additional comment styles are defined in the <tt>hkXXX.emf</tt>
   file with the syntax <tt>.fhook-XXX.comment-N</tt> where <tt>N</tt> is an
   integer starting for <tt>1</tt> to <tt>n</tt>, the number of different
   comment styles. Templates updated to use multiple comment styles where
   appropriate (C, C++ and SQL).</li>
   
   <li>[040310] Support the <b>r</b> flag in <tt>.fhook-XXX.comment</tt> flag
   field. Causes the key binding to <b>esc-o</b> and <b>esc-q</b> to restyle
   the comment. All templates updated to include the flag where
   appropriate.</li>

   <li>[040308] <b>ipipe-shell-command</b> includes additional flag to run in
   <i>raw mode</i> where the buffer is not annotated and wrap is disabled.
   Additional argument added to command to allow the <b>$buffer-ipipe</b>
   macro to be defined when the pipe is defined. Corrected operation of

   macro is still invoked on completion.</li>
   
   <li>[040226] Deleted <tt>cygnus.emf</tt> added <tt>cygwin.emf</tt> for
   cygwin BASH shell support under Windows. Corrected the shell operation

   <li>[040223] Fixed. Executing <b>me</b> (<b>user-setup -&gt; Current</b>)
   breaks <b>auto-spell</b> until a main spell command (<b>spell-word</b> or
   <b>spell-buffer</b>) is executed.</li>
   
   <li>[040223] CVS directory listing file loss solved. Differences between
   CVS command line operations and directory list operations resolved, both
   now produce the same results.</li>
   
   <li>[040229] Fixed UNIX signal lock synchronization, solves problems with

   standard cmd/command as they use 4DOS <tt>&gt;&gt;&amp;</tt> extension.
   Changed to using <tt>2&gt;&amp;1</tt> which works on <b>cmd</b> and

   Affects all UNIX platforms.</li>
   
   <li>[040213] Documented the <b>create</b>/<b>delete</b>/<b>next-frame</b>

   <li>[040210] Fixed toolbar Directory File List does not contain

   <li>[040210] Fixed. On UNIX only the <b>$progname</b> may not be fully

   error and an alternate fix to <b>$search-path</b>.</li>
   
   <li>[040210] Fixed. On UNIX, <b>find-file</b> of a symbolic link which
   points to a directory results in a bad directory listing. The list of
   files is correct but the stats are all wrong (found on sunos 5.8).</li>
   
   <li>[040210] Fix subtle ftp bug with alias ftp addressed. Create an ftp
   site <tt>ftp://test/</tt> say with user name foo and passwd bar and then
   load in <tt>ftp://test/dir1/</tt> the buffer file name is correctly set as
   <tt>ftp://test/dir1/</tt> but the <i>Directory listing of:</i> line is set
   to <tt>ftp://foo@test/dir1/</tt>. Firstly the user may wish the
   <tt>foo</tt> to be hidden but secondly with the introduction of being able
   to click on the <i>Directory listing of:</i> line this has introduced a
   subtle inefficiency/bug, if I click on the <tt>foo@test</tt> ME will load
   <tt>ftp://foo@test/</tt> not <tt>ftp://test/</tt> which to ME is a
   completely different file. This can in turn lead to
   <tt>ftp://foo@test/dir1/</tt> being loaded so you can end up with 2 copies
   of every dir being loaded! The fix is to make the <i>Directory listing
   of:</i> line the same, i.e. <tt>ftp://test/dir1/</tt></li>
   
   <li>[040208] Fixed. <b>-n</b> command line option to a console build
   causes a option failure and the executable does not run.</li>
   
   <li>[040208] Corrected UNIX jasspa tree search when executable is in CWD
   and there is no executable path.</li>

   <li>[040130] 2nd iteration of prototype and near final revision of new
   user setup.<ul>
     
     <p>Following an internal review of RC3 then it has been decided to
     address the issues of user configuration prior to a full release. This
     specifically addresses the location of user MicroEmacs configuration
     directories and search paths. User configuration has traditionally
     required the setting of external environment variables such as
     <tt>$MEPATH</tt> and for the user to create a private directory to store
     user settings. This is proving difficult for new users who just want to
     run the editor. RC4 and subsequent releases will address these problems
     by determining the correct location for configuration files and create
     the appropriate files and directories under user control.</p>
     
     <p>The net result of these  changes  should  significantly  simplify
     installation and setup as follows:</p>
     
     <li>All platforms will be able to run without any manual user setup or
     the requirement for specific MicroEmacs environment variables.</li>
     
     <li>User  defined  directories  and  configuration  files  will  be
     created under editor control on detecting a new user.</li>
     
     <li>Existing installations using <tt>$MEPATH</tt> will be backwards
     compatible with the new build.</li>
     
     <li>All platforms now support a searching jasspa sub-directory structure
     of <tt>company</tt>, <tt>spelling</tt> and <tt>macros</tt>. This was
     traditionally limited to the Windows Install Shield installation but has
     been extended across all platforms.</li>
     
     <li>Two new environment variables are provided for user or system
     administrator use. <tt>$MEINSTALLPATH</tt> defines the location of the
     MicroEmacs standard macros and allows the built in search path to be
     overridden. <tt>$MEUSERPATH</tt> defines the location of the user
     private configuration directory and allows the user to locate their
     private directory in different location. In a standard install neither
     of these variables will be required.</li>
     
     <li>The Microsoft Windows system defined application path will be used
     for user configuration files. This is applicable for roaming users where
     the application directory is stored on a server.</li>
     
     <li>The use of the <tt>me32.ini</tt> file on MicroSoft Windows
     environments is not required, but is still supported.</li>
     
     <li>The UNIX path searching is improved. <tt>/usr/local/microemacs</tt>
     will be depreciated and replaced with <tt>/usr/local/jasspa</tt> in
     addition other standard path locations are supported on a per-platform
     basis.</li>
     
     <li>On UNIX then the directory <tt>~/.jasspa</tt> shall contain the user
     configuration files. Optionally the <tt>company</tt>, <tt>spelling</tt>
     <tt>macros</tt> sub-directories may be included in this directory where
     access to the system directory locations by the user is not
     permitted.</li>
     
     <li>Concept of <i>guest</i> has been removed. <tt>guest.emf</tt> and
     <tt>guest.erf</tt> removed replaced with <tt>newuser</tt>.
     <b>user-setup</b> no longer supports setting of name.</li>
     
     <li>Internal variables <tt>$user-name</tt> and <tt>$user-path</tt> are
     defined.</li>
     
   </ul></li>

   <li>[030710] Improved the special char drawing routines so that they

   <li>[030608] MS-Shift region. Check for <b>kill-rectangle</b> and treat
   like we do the <b>kill-region</b>.</li>
   
   <li>[030608] Added new -ve argument to <b>insert-file</b> which inserts

   <b>$result</b> variable.</li>
   
   <li>[030514] HTML Template. Changed html-fold -&gt; collapse, reported
   goto-matching-tag failure.</li>
   
   <li>[030514] Buffer initialisation. Changed the fold-setup call so that it
   gets called if likely to be required - use the new buffer-fhook $result
   setting to help in determining this.</li>
   
   <li>[030514] Folding. Changed the fold-setup so a setup string can be
   passed in rather than searching for one in the buffer, aimed at utilizing

   <li>[011016] C++ namespace indentation support.</li>
   
   <li>[011016] New language support interface so spelling is not required
   for a language to be supported (may only want the basic alphabet setup
   etc).</li>
   
   <li>[011016] Changed file loading interface so all commands (like
   <b>view-file</b>) can load in bin,crypt or rbin mode.</li>

   <li>[010710] Added a 'Plain Text' char set which only uses plain letters
   (charset.emf).</li>
   
   <li>[010710] Fixed many little comment formatting bugs and annoyances
   (comment.emf).</li>
   
   <li>[010710] Changes required to build on dos using DJGPP v1.</li>
   
   <li>[010705] Bug fix for windows rendering crash.</li>

   X-Server.</li>
   
   <li>[010507] Added generic commands for the creation, deletion and
   reformatting of comments now used by most of the file hooks.</li>
   
   <li>[010412] Added new generic buffer setup, menu and help macros,
   creating the <b>new buffer-setup(3)</b> command. Ported all existing file
   hooks to this new interface greatly reducing the buffer hook size while
   increasing its functionality and consistency.</li>
   
   <li>[010402] Added support for new <b>$buffer-backup(5)</b> variable for
   setting the back-up file location.</li>
   
   <li>[010312] Support for new key bindings allowing CU emulations. Nedit

   <li>[010202] Added new command-wait(2) command to enable macros to wait
   for user dependent completion, used in gdiff.</li>
   
   <li>[010202] Changed buffer variables to except the form
   <tt>:&lt;buffer-name&gt;:&lt;variable&gt;</tt>, like command variables.
   This allows macros to access variable not defined in the current
   buffer.</li>
   
   <li>[010126] File autosave location changes. Control save name and
   location.</li>
   
   <li>[001005] OSD speedups.</li>
   
   <li>[001005] Improved and increased the file system operations via the new
   file-op(2) command, created better menus in the file-browser(3).</li>
   
   <li>[001010] Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more
   rationally.</li>
   
   <li>[001010] Improved ipipe-shell-command efficiency on Windows by
   introducing a new thread approach to listen for activity. Implemented a
   shell command-line in an ipiped environment so ishell(3) command is now
   usable on Windows platforms.</li>
   
   <li>[001010] Added new set-position(2) which can be used to store all
   information about the current window and goto-position(2) which will then
   restore them. Allowed macros to use non-letter characters for alpha marks
   and positions so they no longer need to clobber user ones.</li>
   
   <li>[001010] Added new -k and -u command-line options and improved -s
   option.</li>
   
   <li>[000922] Added GUI for tag dialogue for tags generation.</li>
   
   <li>[000922] Recursive tags support (i.e. nested directory tag
   traversal).</li>
   
   <li>[000810] <tt>emain.h</tt> <tt>#define</tt>'s properly supported again
   so MicroEmacs can be successfully compiled without options like SPELL and
   OSD etc. This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%.</li>
   
   <li>[000718] Source trees now maintained under CVS.</li>
   
   <li>[000719] Improved TCL/TK and Perl template support.</li>
   
   <li>[000704] Improved FTP and HTTP support.</li>
   
   <li>[000620] Java tags support.</li>
   
   <li>[000503] Revised printer support.</li>
   
   <li>[000503] Color printer support (Lexmark).</li>
   
 </ul>

   <li>[000322] New font rendering, supporting bold, italic, underline etc. All
   platforms modified to cope with font scheme definitions. Platforms optimised
   for speed.</li>
   
   <li>[000126] Beta build revision contains version information for
   2000/01/26.</li>
   
   <li>[000126] Directory file copy. Within this release files in the
   directory listings may be selected for copy and pasting from the menu. Use
   the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory buffers. Copy and
   paste to/from a <i>ftp</i> directory buffer to a <i>local</i> drive buffer
   may be used to initiate an ftp transfer. (This is how these pages are
   uploaded).</li>
   
   <li>[000126] New command <b>ftp</b> opens a <i>ftp</i> connection using a
   dialog. Use may save the host connection information in a registry file.
   <i>Note that the password information is exposed so be careful where this
   is used - if in doubt do not enter the password and you will be
   prompted</i>.</li>
   
   <li>[000126] New command <b>uniq</b> operates as the <tt>UNIX</tt> of the
   same name. used with <b>sort,</b> and reduces to unique lines.</li>
   
   <li>[000126] Character translation; addition of character translation
   macros when moving between character sets. Accessible from <b>Menu -&gt;
   Format -&gt; Change Buffer Char Set</b>.</li>
   
   <li>[000126] Support for additional character sets, Windows GREEK, Windows
   TURKISH.</li>
   
   <li>[000126] Line hilighting selection with the use of the mouse and auto
   search. When using the mouse selection to set up the line hilighting when
   invoked from a
   
   <p>
   <ul>
     right-mouse -&gt; Hilight Line -&gt; <i>color/remove</i>
   </ul>
   </p>
   
   <p>selection. The macro determines the mouse selected region and makes an
   appropriate decision as to how the line hilighting scheme is to be
   applied. The following rules apply to the mouse selection:-</p>
   
   <ul>
     
     <li><b>Point in line selected (i.e. mark == point)</b>
     
     <br/>Hilight the line only.</li>
     
     <li><b>Region in the line selected. Both point and mark are on the same
     line.</b>
     
     <br/>Extract the selected text and hilight all lines that match the
     search pattern. The color &quot;remove&quot; is also pattern matched to
     selectively remove lines.</li>
     
     <li><b>Region selected mark & point on different lines</b>
     <br/>Block up the region with appropriate hilight.</li>
     
   </ul>
   
   <p>Note that line hilighting may be safely used in a folded buffer.</p>
   
   </li>
   
   <li>[000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may toggle
   this from the keyboard using a macro in your <i>user</i>.emf as follows:-
   
   <ul>
     <pre>
     
     ; Macro to enable the display of TAB/CR.
     ; Note that we force the screen to be updated.
     define-macro tab-display
     set-variable $system &amp;bxor $system
     0x80000 screen-update
     !emacro
     global-bind-key "tab-display" "f11"</pre>
   </ul></li>
   
   <li>[000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf).</li>
   
   <li>[000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta.</li>
   
   <li>[000112] Revised color hilighting schemes, reduced the number of
   colors in a number of schemes. Introduction of the <b>Sherwood Forest</b>
   color scheme (green theme obviously !!).</li>
   
   <li>[000112] Small revision to the user interface with respect to font
   selection. In order to make character set selection easier then the
   multiple choices for the box characters have been removed from <b>Menu
   -&gt; Help -&gt; User Setup</b>. These have been replaced with a new check
   box <b>Extended Char Set</b>. This box should be checked to enable the
   special rendering characters and enable the box characters - this is
   typically enabled on X-Windows and MS-Windows.</li>
   
   <li>[000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name, modification
   time and size. <i>Selecting the directory column title performs a re-sort
   based on the selection, a further selection reverses the order of the
   list</i>.</li>
   
   <li>[000112] Addition of ftp support (<tt>meu</tt> build on Windows,
   enabled by default on UNIX). Enables files to be edited via ftp, (read and
   write supported). <i>Transfer to another system using
   </i><tt>ftp://[&lt;user&gt;[:&lt;password]@]&gt;&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]/&lt;pathname&gt;</tt>.</li>
   
   <li>[000112] Improved source code provision for foreign languages, various
   internal problems. Support for Russian (Windows and Cyrillic koi8-r).</li>
   
   <li>[000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date.</li>
   
   <li>[000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized wild card
   sequences.
   <ul>
     
     <p>Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf, britishr.emf, etc.) then the
     following spelling rules may be added to cope with numeric sequences.
     The addition of these rules will spell check hexadecimal sequences and
     validate numeric sequences such as <tt>1st</tt>, <tt>2nd</tt>,
     <tt>3rd</tt> etc. A spelling of <tt>1nd</tt> would generate a spelling
     error. This has not been performed for other languages so submissions
     for other language equivalents would be appreciated.</p>
     
     <pre>
     ; Add some special word rules to make life easier.
     ; These are for 1st, 2nd 3rd etc.
     add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?1\\(st\\|ST\\)"
     add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?2\\(nd\\|ND\\)"
     add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?3\\(rd\\|RD\\)"
     add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*1[0-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
     add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*[04-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"

     add-spell-rule "*" "-?\\([0-9]*.\\)?[0-9]+\\(Kg\\|Kb\\|Gb\\|Tb\\|Mb\\|mm\\|cm\\|m\\|Km\\|ft\\|inch\\|mph\\|lb\\|am\\|pm\\)"
     </pre>
     
   </ul>
   </li>
   
   <li>[000112] Box selection copy and paste. Bindings are defined as:-
   
   <p><ul>
     <b>Esc C-w</b> kill-rectangle<br/>
     <b>Esc C-y</b> yank-rectangle
   </ul></p>
   </li>
   
   <li>[000112] Enhanced info file hilighting (Thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth for
   this).</li>
   
   <li>[000112] New <b>copy-file</b> command, typically used by the macro
   language for moving files around.</li>

   Windows environment (Thanks to Pedro Gomes for this).</li>
   
 </ul>
 
 <h3>2nd Release - November 1999</h3>
 <ul>
   
   <li>Enhanced the <b>latex</b> support macros following various
   contributions from users.</li>
   
   <li>Added <i>Favorites</i> to the <i>File</i> pull down menu. This is a
   simple mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites list.</li>
   
   <li>Ground up implementation of the regular expression pattern matcher,
   following licensing problems with the GNU regex. The resultant pattern
   matcher is now a little faster than GNU regex and is capable of all of the
   standard regular expression pattern matches. The pattern matcher has
   diverged from GNU in that double backslashes are required in the character
   classes <tt>[..]</tt> to allow for escape sequence short cuts such as
   '<tt>\n</tt>' (newline), '<tt>\t</tt>' (tab) etc. It was felt that this
   compromise was better than having to quote the more obscure search
   characters.</li>
   
   <li>Changed the hilighting and indenting syntax to be GNU regex
   compliant.</li>
   
   <li>Modified <b>compare-windows</b> to ignore white space by default,
   <b>compare-windows-exact</b> performs an exact character for character
   comparison.</li>
   
   <li>Enhanced the tags support to handle multiple tags and recursive
   directory tree searching.</li>
   
   <li>Implemented osd-help, a gui front end to the on-line help. Required
   changes to the help system which gives macros access to the on-line help
   buffer, needed for the index and search.</li>
   
   <li>Over-hauled the hilighting scheme files and editor to support the
   disabling of buffer hilighting.</li>
   
   <li>Many bugs fixed on all platforms, in particular unix cutting and
   pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit delay.</li>
   
   <li>Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.</li>
   
   <li>Introduced message line variables <b>@mx</b> and <b>@mxa</b>.</li>
   
   <li>New Games - Crossword cracker. The ideal way to cheat at crosswords.
   Uses the spelling dictionary to guess at the word, given a number of known
   letters.</li>
   
   <li>Hook file protection against globally bound keys - prevents re-binding
   of user defined keys within the macro.</li>
   
   <li>Search/Replace fix for exact mode. Environment variable search path
   fix.</li>
   
   <li>hkm4.emf added back into the release (seemed to have gone
   missing).</li>
   
   <li>Cut and paste fix when running the UNIX version through an X-Server
   such as Exceed in the Windows environment.</li>
   
   <li>Plain text printer device added.</li>
   
   <li>Obscure OSD fix.</li>
   
   <li>New OSD help search facility Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;General Help.</li>
   
   <li>Fix for NT hang-up on shut down (typically encountered when running a
   source debugger).</li>
   
   <li>Fix for NT process spawning with spaces in the names.</li>
   
   <li>Metris macro fix, OSD bug fix, NT display fix.</li>
   
   <li>New - color scheme, GVim look.</li>
   
   <li>New - Unix/Linux support for Wheel Mouse (mouse.emf).</li>
   
   <li>New - Color schemes, Plain; for those that do not care for an
   abundance of colors.</li>
   
   <li>Modified the numeric key-pad behaviour to be consistent on all
   platforms. Problems were noted with the UNIX number lock orientation which
   was reversed.</li>
   
   <li>New - Color sheme variables which allow the hkXXX files to determine
   the level of hilighting to apply to their templates.</li>
   
   <li>Line length fix; more graceful behaviour (i.e. does not crash) when
   the line length exceeds 64K.</li>
   
   <li>Intercept the windows 105 keyboard application key (typically right
   hand side of keyboard next to the control key). The key is called "menu".
   By default this is bound in win32.emf, however users may bind it as a
   prefix for their own key combinations in much the same way as
   <code>Alt</code> or <code>C-x</code> if required.</li>
   
   <li>New; OMG's IDL language template added.</li>
   
   <li>Fix for windows short name in <code>next-buffer</code>.</li>
