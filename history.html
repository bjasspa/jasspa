  <h2><img src="images/miniicon.gif" width="16" height="16"> <font color="#0000FF">
  Origins</font></h2>

  <p>This version of MicroEmacs is based on an early <i>MicroEmacs</i> release
  of 3.8 in 1988, the origins of which are unknown, except to say it was
  delivered on a unmarked 5 1/2&quot; floppy disk.

  <p>The program was originally ported to a Motorola MVME147 UNIX box as an
  alternative to <b>vi</b>. Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as
  it constantly crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the development
  of JASSPA's MicroEmacs commenced.

  <p>Development has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole
  oblivious to further developments of the existing <b>MicroEmacs</b> program.
  This was due to no Internet access. It was not until 1996 the next version
  of <b>MicroEmacs</b> and <b>mewin</b> (Microsoft Windows (TM) port of the
  same program) was downloaded from the Internet and compared. By this time
  JASSPA's MicroEmacs was radically different and we were not about to mesh
  the two together - that would be a step backwards.

  <p>Development of JASSPA's MicroEmacs has been biased towards the UNIX
  platform, as most of the early development was performed in the UNIX domain.
  The first of the window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the
  implementation of the Microsoft Windows port. Latterly, we have seen the
  resurgence of the IBM-PC platform which is now commonplace. For the return
  port to the DOS environment, and subsequent development of the Microsoft
  Windows port, a UNIX like interface was required. Most existing users could
  not abide the primitive editors found on these machines; Microsoft Windows
  was an alien and hostile environment when compared with UNIX. Hence, the
  JASSPA's MicroEmacs interface utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across all
  platforms.

  <p>For portability, JASSPA's MicroEmacs utilizes character rendering on all
  platforms regardless of the window manager. Under X-Windows and Microsoft
  Windows, the display is still treated as a character based display, the
  subtle difference is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that
  the scroll bars, fonts etc. are not as slick as they could be, certainly
  under Microsoft Windows JASSPA's MicroEmacs looks positively primitive!!
  Regardless of the look, the goal of a common editor across all working
  platforms has been achieved!

    <li>[011031] Fixed a corking crash! (load random.c and do 2222 replace-string &quot;\n&quot; &quot;&quot;).</li>
    <li>[011029] hklatex.emf item-list support (hit f7).</li>
    <li>[011028] hklatex.emf  has a greatly  improved pseudo  hilighting.</li>
    <li>[011028] Tweaked  the @fs  variable to improve its  usability.</li>
    <li>[011028] set-position can now store the mark position.</li>
    <li>[011028] Fixes to windows file times.</li>
    <li>[011016] New caps-lock, num-lock, scroll-lock and pause key support for win32 & unix. The *-lock implementation to be more like S-pick and
    C-pick as the keys are automatically supported (like the shift) so there are
    no default binds to void, the keys are only generated if there are bound. Could not implement this on DOS.</li>
    <li>[011016] <b>which</b> command built in i.e. &quot;M-x which&quot;. Used for command utilities.</li>

    <li>[011025] Utilised the latest screen-update improvements to make the gdiff screen update rock solid.</li>
    <li>[011025] mlGetChar fix. The key &quot;return&quot; was the 78th special char, i.e. SKEY_SPEC|'N' and as the mlGetChar did not check the SKEY_SPEC bits, pressing return was like pressing 'N' so on a Y/N prompt try pressing return, its like saying No! .</li>
    <li>[011016] Spelling dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because
    of the language changes, you need to rename your personal dictionary to
    lsdpengb.edf for British and lsdpenus.edf for American.</li>
    <li>[011016] Hilighting brackets/braces as requested from user base.
    The hilight braces required some other subtle changes to screen-update and
    show-region and the addition of the rbin mode means that this version is
    incompatible with the last in quite a few areas.</li>
    <li>[011016] Fixed mouse handler (turns out that if the pick event was lost (use @cg or an error) then me would lock!).</li>
    <li>[011016] Extended control on indent tab and return behaviour (can disable the tab behaviour).</li>
    <li>[011016] C++ namespace indentation support.</li>
    <li>[011016] New language support interface so spelling is not required for a language to be supported (may only want the basic alphabet setup etc).</li>
    <li>[011016] Changed file loading interface so all commands (like view-file) can load in bin,crypt or rbin mode.</li>
    <li>[010123] Reduced binary mode added (rbin).</li>
  </ul>

    for speed.</li>
    <li>[000126] Beta build revision contains version information for 2000/01/26.</li>
    <li>[000126] Directory file copy. Within this release files in the directory listings may be selected
    for copy and pasting from the menu. Use the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory
    buffers. Copy and paste to/from a <i>ftp</i> directory buffer to a <i>local</i> drive buffer
    may be used to initiate an ftp transfer. (This is how these pages are uploaded).
    <li>[000126] New command <b>ftp</b> opens a <i>ftp</i> connection using a
    dialog. Use may save the host connection information in a registry file.
    <i>Note that the password information is exposed so be careful where this is
    used - if in doubt do not enter the password and you will be prompted</i>.</li>
    <li>[000126] New command <b>uniq</b> operates as the <tt>UNIX</tt> of the same
    name. used with <b>sort,</b> and reduces to unique lines.</li>
    <li>[000126] Character translation; addition of character translation macros
    when moving between character sets. Accessible from <b>Menu -&gt; Format -&gt;
    Change Buffer Char Set</b>.</li>
    <li>[000126] Support for additional character sets, Windows GREEK, Windows
    TURKISH.</li>
    <li>[000126] Line hilighting selection with the use of the mouse and auto
    search. When using the mouse  selection  to set up the line
    hilighting when invoked from a
    <p>
    <ul>right-mouse -&gt; Hilight Line -&gt; <i>color/remove</i>
    </ul></p>
    <p>selection. The macro  determines  the mouse  selected  region and
    makes  an  appropriate  decision  as to how the  line  hilighting
    scheme is to be applied. The following rules apply to the mouse selection:-
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Point in line selected (i.e. mark == point)</b><br>
      Hilight the line only.
      <li><b>Region in the line  selected.  Both point and mark are on
      the same line.</b><br>
      Extract  the  selected  text and  hilight  all lines that
      match the  search  pattern.  The color  &quot;remove&quot;  is also
      pattern matched to selectively remove lines.
      <li><b>Region selected mark & point on different lines</b></br>
      Block up the region with appropriate hilight.
    </ul>
    <p>
    Note that line  hilighting may be safely used in a folded buffer.</p>.</li>
    <li>[000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may toggle this from the keyboard
    using a macro in your <i>user</i>.emf as follows:-
    <p><ul><pre>
      ; Macro to enable the display of TAB/CR. Note that we
      ; force the screen to be updated.
      define-macro tab-display
      set-variable $system &amp;bxor $system 0x80000
      screen-update
      !emacro
      global-bind-key "tab-display" "f11"
      </pre></ul>
    <li>[000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf).
    <li>[000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta.
    <li>[000112] Revised color hilighting schemes, reduced the number of colors in
    a number of schemes. Introduction of
    the <b>Sherwood Forest</b> color scheme (green theme obviously !!).</li>
    <li>[000112] Small revision to the user interface with respect to font selection. In order to make character set
    selection easier then the multiple choices for the box characters have been removed from <b>Menu -&gt; Help -&gt; User Setup</b>. These have been replaced with
    a new check box <b>Extended Char  Set</b>. This box should be checked to enable the special rendering characters and
    enable the box characters - this is typically enabled on X-Windows and MS-Windows.</li>
    <li>[000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name, modification time
    and size.
    <i>Selecting the directory column title performs a re-sort based on the
    selection, a further selection reverses the order of the list</i>.</li>
    <li>[000112] Addition of ftp support (<tt>meu</tt> build on Windows, enabled by default on UNIX). Enables files to be edited via ftp,
    (read and write supported).
    <i>Transfer to another system using
    </i><tt>ftp://[&lt;user&gt;[:&lt;password]@]&gt;&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]/&lt;pathname&gt;</tt>.</li>
    <li>[000112] Improved source code provision for foreign languages, various
    internal problems. Support for Russian (Windows and Cyrillic koi8-r).</li>
    <li>[000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date.</li>
    <li>[000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized wild card
    sequences.
    <ul>
      <p>Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf, britishr.emf, etc.) then the
      following spelling rules may be added to cope with
      numeric sequences. The addition of these rules will spell check hexadecimal
      sequences and validate numeric sequences such as <tt>1st</tt>, <tt>2nd</tt>, <tt>3rd</tt> etc.
      A spelling of <tt>1nd</tt> would generate a spelling error. This has not been performed
      for other languages so submissions for other language equivalents would be
      appreciated.
      <pre>
      ; Add some special word rules to make life easier.
      ; These are for 1st, 2nd 3rd etc.
      add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?1\\(st\\|ST\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?2\\(nd\\|ND\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?3\\(rd\\|RD\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*1[0-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*[04-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+"
      ; Spell rules for unit definitions.
      ; These are for 50Mb, 10Kg, -45.56cm 12ft 10.00am 16.00pm etc.
      add-spell-rule "*" "-?\\([0-9]*.\\)?[0-9]+\\(Kg\\|Kb\\|Gb\\|Tb\\|Mb\\|mm\\|cm\\|m\\|Km\\|ft\\|inch\\|mph\\|lb\\|am\\|pm\\)"
      </pre>
    </ul>
    .</li>
    <li>[000112] Box selection copy and paste. Bindings are defined as:-
    <p><ul>
      <b>Esc C-w</b> kill-rectangle<br>
      <b>Esc C-y</b> yank-rectangle
    </ul></p>.</li>
    <li>[000112] Enhanced info file hilighting (Thanks to Detlef for this).</li>
    <li>[000112] New <b>copy-file</b> command, typically used by the macro language for moving files around.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>2nd Release - November 1999</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Enhanced the <b>latex</b> support macros following various contributions from users.</li>
    <li>Added  <i>Favorites</i>  to the  <i>File</i>  pull down  menu. This is a simple mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites list.</li>
    <li>Ground up implementation of the regular  expression pattern matcher, following
    licensing problems with the GNU regex. The resultant pattern matcher is now a
    little  faster  than GNU regex and is capable of all of the  standard  regular
    expression pattern matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that
    double  backslashes are required in the character classes  <tt>[..]</tt> to allow
    for escape  sequence  short cuts such as  '<tt>\n</tt>'  (newline),  '<tt>\t</tt>'
    (tab) etc. It was felt that this  compromise  was better  than having to quote
    the more obscure search characters.</li>
    <li>Changed the hilighting and indenting syntax to be GNU regex compliant.</li>
    <li>Modified <b>compare-windows</b> to ignore white space by default, <b>compare-windows-exact</b> performs an exact character for character comparison.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the tags support to handle multiple tags and recursive directory tree searching.</li>
    <li>Implemented osd-help, a gui front end to the on-line help. Required changes to the help system which gives macros  access to the on-line help buffer,  needed for the index and search.</li>
    <li>Over-hauled the hilighting scheme files and editor to support the disabling of buffer hilighting.</li>
    <li>Many bugs fixed on all  platforms,  in  particular  unix  cutting  and pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit delay.</li>
    <li>Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.</li>
    <li>Introduced message line variables <b>@mx</b> and <b>@mxa</b>.</li>
    <li>New Games - Crossword cracker. The ideal way to cheat at crosswords. Uses the spelling dictionary to guess at the word, given a number of known letters.</li>
    <li>Hook file protection against globally bound keys - prevents re-binding of user defined keys within the macro.</li>
    <li>Search/Replace fix for exact mode. Environment variable search path fix.</li>
    <li>hkm4.emf added back into the release (seemed to have gone missing).</li>
    <li>Cut and paste fix when running the UNIX version through an X-Server such as Exceed in the Windows environment.</li>
    <li>Plain text printer device added.</li>

    <li>New OSD help search facility Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;General Help.</li>
    <li>Fix for NT hang-up on shut down (typically encountered when running a source debugger).</li>
    <li>Fix for NT process spawning with spaces in the names.</li>
    <li>Metris macro fix, OSD bug fix, NT display fix.</li>
    <li>New - color scheme, GVim look.</li>
    <li>New - Unix/Linux support for Wheel Mouse (mouse.emf).</li>
    <li>New - Color schemes, Plain; for those that do not care for an abundance of colors.</li>
    <li>Modified the numeric key-pad behaviour to be consistent on all platforms. Problems were noted with the UNIX number lock orientation which was reversed.</li>
    <li>New - Color sheme variables which allow the hkXXX files to determine the level of hilighting to apply to their templates.</li>
    <li>Line length fix; more graceful behaviour (i.e. does not crash) when the line length exceeds 64K.</li>
    <li>Intercept the windows 105 keyboard application key (typically right hand side of keyboard next to the control key). The key is called "menu".
    By default this is bound in win32.emf, however users may bind it as a prefix
    for their own key combinations in much the same way as <code>Alt</code> or
    <code>C-x</code> if required.</li>
    <li>New; OMG's IDL language template added.</li>
    <li>Fix for windows short name in <code>next-buffer</code>.</li>
  </ul>
