<h2><img src="images/miniicon.gif" width="16" height="16"> <font color="#0000FF">
Origins</font></h2>

<p>This version of MicroEmacs is based on an early <i>MicroEmacs</i> release
of 3.8 in 1988, the origins of which are unknown, except to say it was
delivered on a unmarked 5 1/2&quot; floppy disk.

<p>The program was originally ported to a Motorola MVME147 UNIX box as an
alternative to <b>vi</b>. Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as
it constantly crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the development
of JASSPA's MicroEmacs commenced.

<p>Development has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole
oblivious to further developments of the existing <b>MicroEmacs</b> program.
This was due to no Internet access. It was not until 1996 the next version of
<b>MicroEmacs</b> and <b>mewin</b> (Microsoft Windows (TM) port of the same
program) was downloaded from the Internet and compared. By this time JASSPA's
MicroEmacs was radically different and we were not about to mesh the two
together - that would be a step backwards.

<p>Development of JASSPA's MicroEmacs has been biased towards the UNIX platform, as
most of the early development was performed in the UNIX domain. The
first of the window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the
implementation of the Microsoft Windows port. Latterly, we have seen the
resurgence of the IBM-PC platform which is now commonplace. For the return
port to the DOS environment, and subsequent development of the Microsoft
Windows port, a UNIX like interface was required. Most existing users
could not abide the primitive editors found on these machines; Microsoft
Windows was an alien and hostile environment when compared with UNIX. Hence,
the JASSPA's MicroEmacs interface utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across all
platforms.

<p>For portability, JASSPA's MicroEmacs utilizes character rendering on all
platforms regardless of the window manager. Under X-Windows and Microsoft
Windows, the display is still treated as a character based display, the subtle
difference is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that the scroll
bars, fonts etc. are not as slick as they could be, certainly under Microsoft
Windows JASSPA's MicroEmacs looks positively primitive!! Regardless of the
look, the goal of a common editor across all working platforms has been
achieved!

  <li>[011220] Moved the template etfinsrt calls into the buffer-initialize macro </li>
  <li>[011220] Fixed the exec fhook-cpp not working </li>
  <li>[011220] Fixes to ctags for C++ function call initialisers</li>
  <li>[011220] Fixed Windows Console &lt;RETURN&gt; key keyboard mapping, returning incorrect binding</li>
  <li>[011219] Fixed Termcap &lt;TAB&gt; key translation</li>
  <li>[011219] Fixed Termcap tparm() to use a default stack argument if not specified by default.</li>
  <li>[011219] Added cygwin support to the build file</li>
  <li>[011219] Added extra argument to buffer-initialise.</li>
  <li>[011218] Added support for Euphoria language.</li>
  <li>[011217] Italian spelling dictionary</li>
  <li>[011217] Added scheme support for fence matching colors.</li>
  <li>[011217] Removed global binding of TAB key from unixterm.emf and build in translation.</li>
  <li>[011215] Fixed cygwin makefile for latest version, added cygwin macros</li>
  <li>[011215] Fixed remaining termcap crash under cygwin.</li>
  <li>[011214] Merged prototype cygwin code base into release, use poll() following select()</li>
  <li>[011123] Fence matching added to user sertup (user-setup -&gt; Platform -&gt; Fence Display)</li>
  <li>[011115] Reworked the buffer hooks such that mybhook/myehook can be defined.</li>
  <li>[011031] Fixed a corking crash! (load random.c and do 2222 replace-string &quot;\n&quot; &quot;&quot;)</li>
  <li>[011029] hklatex.emf item-list support (hit f7)</li>
  <li>[011028] hklatex.emf  has a greatly  improved pseudo  hilighting</li>
  <li>[011028] Tweaked  the @fs  variable to improve its  usability</li>
  <li>[011028] set-position can now store the mark position</li>
  <li>[011028] Fixes to windows file times</li>
  <li>[011016] New caps-lock, num-lock, scroll-lock and pause key support for win32 & unix. The *-lock implementation to be more like S-pick and
  C-pick as the keys are automatically supported (like the shift) so there are
  no default binds to void, the keys are only generated if there are bound. Could not implement this on DOS.</li>
  <li>[011016] <b>which</b> command built in i.e. &quot;M-x which&quot;. Used for command utilities.</li>
  <li>[011026] A new Hide value feature when inputting strings, this is now used be the crypt and ftp Password
  entry. The string is shown as '*'s.</li>
  <li>[011025] Utilised the latest screen-update improvements to make the gdiff screen update rock solid</li>
  <li>[011025] mlGetChar fix. The key &quot;return&quot; was the 78th special char, i.e. SKEY_SPEC|'N' and as the mlGetChar did not check the SKEY_SPEC bits, pressing return was like pressing 'N' so on a Y/N prompt try pressing return, its like saying No! </li>
  <li>[011016] Spelling dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because
  of the language changes, you need to rename your personal dictionary to
  lsdpengb.edf for British and lsdpenus.edf for American.</li>
  <li>[011016] Hilighting brackets/braces as requested from user base.
  The hilight braces required some other subtle changes to screen-update and
  show-region and the addition of the rbin mode means that this version is
  incompatible with the last in quite a few areas.</li>
  <li>[011016] Fixed mouse handler (turns out that if the pick event was lost (use @cg or an error) then me would lock!)</li>
  <li>[011016] Extended control on indent tab and return behaviour (can disable the tab behaviour)</li>
  <li>[011016] C++ namespace indentation support</li>
  <li>[011016] New language support interface so spelling is not required for a language to be supported (may only want the basic alphabet setup etc).</li>
  <li>[011016] Changed file loading interface so all commands (like view-file) can load in bin,crypt or rbin mode.</li>
  <li>[010123] Reduced binary mode added (rbin)</li>
</ul>  
<h3>4th Release - August 2001</h3>

  <li>[010716] Minor macros modification to font selection for schemes. Default guest setup font
  selection for cleaner 'first' page.</li>
  <li>[010716] CVS macro update. Changed <tt>cvs-diff</tt> to <tt>cvs-gdiff</tt> and introduced a new
  <tt>cvs-diff</tt> which just gives the <i>diff</i> output and fixed several bugs when

  <li>[010312] Support for new key bindings allowing CU emulations. Nedit bindings provided as example. Major work to enable the complete rebinding of all keys so the user interface to MicroEmacs can be completely changed, this allows for example a Windows feel to be created. This required many internal ghosts to be exorcised and add new macro functions.</li>

  <li>[001010] Added new set-position(2) which can be used to store all information about the current window and goto-position(2) which will then restore them. Allowed macros to use non-letter characters for alpha marks and positions so they no longer need to clobber user ones.</li>
  <li>[001010] Added new -k and -u command-line options and improved -s option.</li>
  <li>[000922] Added GUI for tag dialogue for tags generation.</li>
  <li>[000922] Recursive tags support (i.e. nested directory tag traversal).</li>
  <li>[000810] <tt>emain.h</tt> <tt>#define</tt>'s properly supported again so MicroEmacs can be successfully compiled without options like SPELL and OSD etc. This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%.</li>

<li>[000126] Beta build revision contains version information for 2000/01/26</li>
<li>[000126] Directory file copy. Within this release files in the directory listings may be selected
for copy and pasting from the menu. Use the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory
buffers. Copy and paste to/from a <i>ftp</i> directory buffer to a <i>local</i> drive buffer
may be used to initiate an ftp transfer. (This is how these pages are uploaded).
<li>[000126] New command <b>ftp</b> opens a <i>ftp</i> connection using a
dialog. Use may save the host connection information in a registry file.
<i>Note that the password information is exposed so be careful where this is
used - if in doubt do not enter the password and you will be prompted</i></li>
<li>[000126] New command <b>uniq</b> operates as the <tt>UNIX</tt> of the same
name. used with <b>sort,</b> and reduces to unique lines</li>
<li>[000126] Character translation; addition of character translation macros
when moving between character sets. Accessible from <b>Menu -&gt; Format -&gt;
Change Buffer Char Set</b></li>
<li>[000126] Support for additional character sets, Windows GREEK, Windows
TURKISH</li>
<li>[000126] Line hilighting selection with the use of the mouse and auto
search. When using the mouse  selection  to set up the line
hilighting when invoked from a
<p>
<ul>right-mouse -&gt; Hilight Line -&gt; <i>color/remove</i>
</ul></p>
<p>selection. The macro  determines  the mouse  selected  region and
makes  an  appropriate  decision  as to how the  line  hilighting
scheme is to be applied. The following rules apply to the mouse selection:-
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Point in line selected (i.e. mark == point)</b><br>
Hilight the line only.
<li><b>Region in the line  selected.  Both point and mark are on
the same line.</b><br>
Extract  the  selected  text and  hilight  all lines that
match the  search  pattern.  The color  &quot;remove&quot;  is also
pattern matched to selectively remove lines.
<li><b>Region selected mark & point on different lines</b></br>
Block up the region with appropriate hilight.
</ul>
<p>
Note that line  hilighting may be safely used in a folded buffer.</p></li>
<li>[000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may toggle this from the keyboard 
using a macro in your <i>user</i>.emf as follows:-
<p><ul><pre>
; Macro to enable the display of TAB/CR. Note that we
; force the screen to be updated.
define-macro tab-display
    set-variable $system &amp;bxor $system 0x80000
    screen-update
!emacro
global-bind-key "tab-display" "f11"
</pre></ul>
<li>[000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf).
<li>[000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta.
<li>[000112] Revised color hilighting schemes, reduced the number of colors in
a number of schemes. Introduction of
the <b>Sherwood Forest</b> color scheme (green theme obviously !!)</li>
<li>[000112] Small revision to the user interface with respect to font selection. In order to make character set
selection easier then the multiple choices for the box characters have been removed from <b>Menu -&gt; Help -&gt; User Setup</b>. These have been replaced with 
a new check box <b>Extended Char  Set</b>. This box should be checked to enable the special rendering characters and 
enable the box characters - this is typically enabled on X-Windows and MS-Windows.</li>
<li>[000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name, modification time
and size.
<i>Selecting the directory column title performs a re-sort based on the
selection, a further selection reverses the order of the list</i></li>
<li>[000112] Addition of ftp support (<tt>meu</tt> build on Windows, enabled by default on UNIX). Enables files to be edited via ftp,
(read and write supported).
<i>Transfer to another system using
</i><tt>ftp://[&lt;user&gt;[:&lt;password]@]&gt;&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]/&lt;pathname&gt;</tt></li>
<li>[000112] Improved source code provision for foreign languages, various
internal problems. Support for Russian (Windows and Cyrillic koi8-r)</li>
<li>[000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date</li>
<li>[000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized wild card
sequences.
<ul>
<p>Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf, britishr.emf, etc.) then the
following spelling rules may be added to cope with
numeric sequences. The addition of these rules will spell check hexadecimal
sequences and validate numeric sequences such as <tt>1st</tt>, <tt>2nd</tt>, <tt>3rd</tt> etc.
A spelling of <tt>1nd</tt> would generate a spelling error. This has not been performed
for other languages so submissions for other language equivalents would be
appreciated.
<pre>
; Add some special word rules to make life easier.
; These are for 1st, 2nd 3rd etc.
add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?1\\(st\\|ST\\)"
add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?2\\(nd\\|ND\\)"
add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?3\\(rd\\|RD\\)"
add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*1[0-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*[04-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
add-spell-rule "*" "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+"
; Spell rules for unit definitions.
; These are for 50Mb, 10Kg, -45.56cm 12ft 10.00am 16.00pm etc.
add-spell-rule "*" "-?\\([0-9]*.\\)?[0-9]+\\(Kg\\|Kb\\|Gb\\|Tb\\|Mb\\|mm\\|cm\\|m\\|Km\\|ft\\|inch\\|mph\\|lb\\|am\\|pm\\)"
</pre>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[000112] Box selection copy and paste. Bindings are defined as:-
<p><ul>
<b>Esc C-w</b> kill-rectangle<br>
<b>Esc C-y</b> yank-rectangle
</ul></p></li>
<li>[000112] Enhanced info file hilighting (Thanks to Detlef for this)</li>
<li>[000112] New <b>copy-file</b> command, typically used by the macro language for moving files around</li>
<li>[000112] Error reporting of bad command line arguments in Microsoft Windows environment (Thanks to Pedro Gomes for this)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2nd Release - November 1999</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced the <b>latex</b> support macros following various contributions from users.</li>
<li>Added  <i>Favorites</i>  to the  <i>File</i>  pull down  menu. This is a simple mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites list.</li>
<li>Ground up implementation of the regular  expression pattern matcher, following
licensing problems with the GNU regex. The resultant pattern matcher is now a 
little  faster  than GNU regex and is capable of all of the  standard  regular
expression pattern matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that
double  backslashes are required in the character classes  <tt>[..]</tt> to allow
for escape  sequence  short cuts such as  '<tt>\n</tt>'  (newline),  '<tt>\t</tt>'
(tab) etc. It was felt that this  compromise  was better  than having to quote
the more obscure search characters.</li>
<li>Changed the hilighting and indenting syntax to be GNU regex compliant.</li>
<li>Modified <b>compare-windows</b> to ignore white space by default, <b>compare-windows-exact</b> performs an exact character for character comparison.</li>
<li>Enhanced the tags support to handle multiple tags and recursive directory tree searching.</li>
<li>Implemented osd-help, a gui front end to the on-line help. Required changes to the help system which gives macros  access to the on-line help buffer,  needed for the index and search.</li>
<li>Over-hauled the hilighting scheme files and editor to support the disabling of buffer hilighting.</li>
<li>Many bugs fixed on all  platforms,  in  particular  unix  cutting  and pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit delay.</li>
<li>Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.</li>
<li>Introduced message line variables <b>@mx</b> and <b>@mxa</b>.</li>
<li>New Games - Crossword cracker. The ideal way to cheat at crosswords. Uses the spelling dictionary to guess at the word, given a number of known letters.</li>
<li>Hook file protection against globally bound keys - prevents re-binding of user defined keys within the macro.</li>
<li>Search/Replace fix for exact mode. Environment variable search path fix.</li>
<li>hkm4.emf added back into the release (seemed to have gone missing)</li>
<li>Cut and paste fix when running the UNIX version through an X-Server such as Exceed in the Windows environment.</li>
<li>Plain text printer device added</li>
<li>Obscure OSD fix</li>
<li>New OSD help search facility Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;General Help</li>
<li>Fix for NT hang-up on shut down (typically encountered when running a source debugger).</li>
<li>Fix for NT process spawning with spaces in the names.</li>
<li>Metris macro fix, OSD bug fix, NT display fix.</li>
<li>New - color scheme, GVim look</li>
<li>New - Unix/Linux support for Wheel Mouse (mouse.emf)</li>
