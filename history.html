  <h2><img src="images/miniicon.gif" width="16" height="16"/> <font color="#0000FF">
  Origins</font></h2>

  <p><b>MicroEmacs</b> was originally written by Dave Conroy in late 1985 or
  early 1986 for private use. Various people asked Dave for a copy of the
  program and it was distributed without concern for copyrights or ownership
  as was the custom of that era. Daniel Lawrence then obtained a copy of the
  program and turned it into an editor for the masses, it is his work
  that ultimately made MicroEmacs so popular. Daniel did a tremendous amount
  of work, both adding features and supporting other platforms resulting in
  the MicroEmacs v3.8 release on which JASSPA's MicroEmacs is based.</p>

  <p>The evolution of JASSPA's MicroEmacs starts here ...</p>

  <p>This version of MicroEmacs is based on an early <i>MicroEmacs</i> release
  of 3.8 in 1988 by Daniel M. Lawrence, the origins of the exact source base
  are unknown, except to say it was delivered on a unmarked 5 1/2&quot; floppy
  disk.</p>

  <p>The program was originally ported to a Motorola MVME147 UNIX box as an
  alternative to <b>vi</b>. Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as
  it constantly crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the development
  of JASSPA's MicroEmacs commenced.</p>

  <p>Development has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole
  oblivious to further developments of the existing <b>MicroEmacs</b> program.
  This was due to no Internet access. It was not until 1996 the next version
  of <b>MicroEmacs</b> and <b>mewin</b> (Microsoft Windows (TM) port of the
  same program) was downloaded from the Internet and compared. By this time
  JASSPA's MicroEmacs was radically different and we were not about to mesh
  the two together - that would be a step backwards.</p>

  <p>Development of JASSPA's MicroEmacs has been biased towards the UNIX
  platform, as most of the early development was performed in the UNIX domain.
  The first of the window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the
  implementation of the Microsoft Windows port. Latterly, we have seen the
  resurgence of the IBM-PC platform which is now commonplace. For the return
  port to the DOS environment, and subsequent development of the Microsoft
  Windows port, a UNIX like interface was required. Most existing users could
  not abide the primitive editors found on these machines; Microsoft Windows
  was an alien and hostile environment when compared with UNIX. Hence, the
  JASSPA's MicroEmacs interface utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across all
  platforms.</p>

  <p>For portability, JASSPA's MicroEmacs utilizes character rendering on all
  platforms regardless of the window manager. Under X-Windows and Microsoft
  Windows, the display is still treated as a character based display, the
  subtle difference is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that
  the scroll bars, fonts etc. are not as slick as they could be, certainly
  under Microsoft Windows JASSPA's MicroEmacs looks positively primitive!!
  Regardless of the look, the goal of a common editor across all working
  platforms has been achieved!</p>

    <li>[050508] JASSPA MicroEmacs 8th release - final. Core and macro
    versions 20050505.</li>
    
    <li>[050514] Fixed ftp copy lock-up (most noticable on windows) caused by
    the response read at the start of a command also reading (and disgarding)
    the finishing message so ME hangs at the end of the command waiting for a
    response.</li>

    <li>[050514] Enabled ipipes under cygwin by default.</li>

    <li>[050514] Fixed win32s build.</li>

    <li>[050514] Fixed mecygwin interactive MS-DOS and cygwin BASH
    shells.</li>

    <li>[050513] Found the UNIX <b>waitpid(-1,...)</b> in the sigchild handler
    (which removes any zoombie processes) removes the pipe commands process so
    the <b>pclose</b> call cannot get the process's exit code (returns
    -1).</li>

    <li>[050509] Changed the name of <b>aix43</b> make files to <b>aix4</b>
    and <b>sunos55</b> and <b>sunos56</b> files to a single <b>sunos5</b>

    <li>[050505] Base version numbers reset for next release.</li>
    
    <li>[050429] Added support for keybinding to item-list column ordering,
    function is <b>item-list-order</b> and is bound to <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>
    and <tt>3</tt> by default. Thanks to Bryan Schofield for his submission in
    this area.</li>

    <li>[050429] Spelling - protect '<tt>.</tt>'s in the word with

    <li>[050428] Corrected TCL hilighting w.r.t. comment at end of line -
    submitted by Bryan Schofield.</li>

    <li>[050427] Major reworking of main commands in a directory listing
    buffer. Implemented typical features found in an OFM standard browser and
    create standard bindings as well as termcap friendly ones. Changed delete
    binding to delete files rather than close browser which is now bound to
    f10.</li>

    <li>[050427] osd - Added numeric bit 8 on <b>osd-entry</b> arg to put the
    text above the entry.</li>

    <li>[050427] Added <b>C-x&nbsp;k</b> support to browser mode to kill the
    buffer, also added hook for the <b>file-browser</b>'s view file.</li>

    <li>[050427] Fixed <b>user-setup</b> to use only one value of
    <b>$file-ignore</b> &amp; $kept-versions per platform rather than one for
    window and one for console based versions.</li>

    <li>[050427] Shrunk the size of the file-attrib dialog to ensure it fits
    on a termcap screen.</li>

    <li>[050427] Fixed nasty bug with <b>transpose-line</b> at the end of the
    buffer swapping the last line with the first!</li>

    <li>[050427] <tt>main.c</tt> - Fixed minor compiler warnings.</li>

    <li>[050426] Added a binding for file completion (any key bound to
    <b>insert-tab</b>) so OSD dialogs can do completion (although
    awkwardly).</li>

    <li>[050423] Fixed wiki edit mode for Russian keyboards, the '<tt>k</tt>'
    flag key mapping was breaking things.</li>

    <li>[050423] Windows - Fixed windows Ctrl numeric pad keys, now come
    through as <b>C-0</b> ... <b>C-9</b>, <b>C-*</b>, <b>C-+</b> etc.</li>

    <li>[050420] Added new Dot/Neato support fhook (for <tt>.dot</tt> files) -
    thanks to Detlef for the submission.</li>

    <li>[050420] TCL - Added more hilight tokens from Detlef.</li>

    <li>[050420] Document macros - fixed cpp-&gt;tcl typo - thanks to Detlef
    for spotting this.</li>

    <li>[050410] Fixed the <b>-R</b> option for DOS box, cursor same as the
    foreground color which is not ideal!</li>

    <li>[050410] Fixed the SunOS x86 makefile to disabled #pragam warnings
    under GCC.</li>

    <li>[050409] Release Candidate 2 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC2)</li>

    <li>[050408] Added flag to the <b>user-setup</b> Tools to force the
    rereading of the current buffer's file, thanks to Bryan Schofield.</li>

    <li>[050408] Added new <b>.item-list.width</b> variable to allow control
    of the item window list - submitted by Bryan Schofield.</li>

    <li>[050408] Moved the generate tags into the sub folder and added a
    compile option to c and cpp - submitted by Bryan Schofield.</li>

    <li>[050405] Added support for DOS code page 866 (Cyrillic Russion) -
    submitted by Nicholas Kudriavtsev</li>

    <li>[050331] Added support for the setting of the history in macros via
    <b>@h#</b>.</li>

    <li>[050325] <tt>registry.c</tt> - removed compiler warning indicating
    porting problem hilighted under Darwin. Post increment of variable on left
    of assignment and same variable appeared on the right, split out the
    increment to reduce ambiguity of the statement.</li>

    <li>[050320] UNIX only - add a rule for <tt>.dir</tt> files found in the
    X11 directory. We do not want this files identified as "<tt>dir</tt>" info
    root file</li>

    <li>[050320] Added termcap (white) scheme for reverse video
    operation.</li>

    <li>[050320] Newuser registry file - added default entry for Apple Mac
    "<i>darwin</i>". Confirmed operation under Mac X-Windows.</li>

    <li>[050320] Extended ME exit commands to support the discarding of
    modified buffers '<tt>0x8</tt> discard modified buffers' and
    '<tt>0x10</tt> discard modified buffers and create recovery file for
    changes'.</li>

    <li>[050320] Corrected XML syntax for strings "<tt>...</tt>" to fix indent
    and hilight anomalies.</li>

    <li>[050319] Added <b>-R</b> command line option to reverse the built in
    video schemes - specifically for <b>ne(1)</b> also works with
    <b>me(1)</b>.</li>

    <li>[050319] Corrected default mode settings. Recent removal of
    <b>letter(2m)</b>, <b>line(2m)</b> etc. changed the mode byte assignment
    of some modes. The built in global mode default was not updated for this
    change in bytes and incorrect global modes appeared as a result -
    specifically <b>quiet(2m)</b> which has jumped bytes.</li>

    <li>[050315] LEX/YACC template - Corrected LEX and YACC highlighting.
    Aligned C, C++ and YACC/LEX templates to be consistent.</li>

    <li>[050315] C/C++ templates - buffer setup modified for GNU Indent Style
    setting.</li>

    <li>[050315] Added new <b>browse(3)</b> command and binding to <b>f3</b>,
    changed existing <b>collapse-all</b> <b>f3</b> binding to
    <b>C-f2</b>.</li>

    <li>[050315] Modified ME exit commands to support a bitwise arg <i>n</i>
    where main <b>exit-emacs</b> has '<tt>0x01 Prompt</tt>', '<tt>0x02 Save
    each buffer/reg/dic (with prompt if 0x01 set)</tt>' and '<tt>0x04 Prompt
    for exit code and exit ME with that code.</tt>'</li>

    <li>[050313] Latex template - Corrected the <b>latex-fill-paragraph</b>.
    Set the fill-mode to '<b>l</b>' rather than '<b>L</b>' because its a pain
    when it selects centre rather than left and messes things up.</li>

    <li>[050311] Directory list - changed column sorting so <i>Modified</i> is
    sorted most recent first.</li>

    <li>[050311] Fixed <b>perldb</b> pipe operation.</li>

    <li>[050310] OSD simplified the main context menu and moved paste a cvs
    items in the directory context menu</li>

    <li>[050310] Fixed diff's file name input, was not completing
    correctly</li>

    <li>[050310] CVS changed the default setting of the recursive add to
    off.</li>

    <li>[050310] JASSPA MicroEmacs quick start document released.</li>

    <li>[050309] Fixed bug in regex multi-line search backwards, searching for
    "<tt>foo[^a]</tt>" is a mult-line as <tt>[^a]</tt> matches <tt>\\n</tt>,
    if "<b>foob</b>" exists at the start of the line <b>isearch-backward</b>
    refuses to move on.</li>

    <li>[050309] Catman pages added for <b>ne(1)</b> and <b>me(1)</b>
    complaints with gentoo as missing. Added to the package builds.</li>

    <li>[050308] Fixed a nasty bug with ftp connect dialog when the host has a
    port. Changed the default path to be nothing which becomes <b>/~/</b> to
    list the login directory. Change the tab order to not include the password
    as tabbing through the entry will lose the password, must now access via
    mouse or hot key which is not ideal.</li>

    <li>[050308] Added support for relative ftp browsing via new
    <b>ftp://???/~/???</b> url form. Added file name completion support for
    <b>ftp</b></li>

    <li>[050306] Corrected the docmacro <b>http://</b>ling regular
    expression.</li>

    <li>[050306] Changed the date format of the -V command line option to
    include the century, same format as the about(2) buffer.</li>

    <li>[050302] HTLP and PHP - fixed indent problems.</li>

    <li>[050302] Perl template - fixed indent problems caused by not skipping
    the <b>=~</b> type regex's</li>

    <li>[050302] TCL template - fixed continuation and comment indent
    bug.</li>

    <li>[050302] Added support for R/S-plus (.r) files - thanks to
    Detlef.</li>

    <li>[050225] HTML template - fixed an indent which was fixed at
    "<tt>2</tt>" rather than "<tt>t</tt>" and added comment skipping indent
    rules</li>

    <li>[050225] <b>dos2unix</b>, <b>unix2dos</b> and <b>unix2win</b> -
    Removed use of <b>&amp;spr</b> in favor of <b>&amp;cat</b> so
    <b>dos2unix</b> etc work in ne.</li>

    <li>[050225] Tracing a problem with hilighting a token of the form
    "<tt>AB*$</tt>", works if there is a <b>B</b> but fails if there are no
    '<b>B</b>'s, i.e. only matches "<tt>AB+$</tt>". Found that removing the
    end of line special case code fixes the problem. I believe the rest of the
    code has been improved to handle any end-of-line quirks - I hope so!</li>

    <li>[050225] Removed the '<b>start-up</b>' macro function compile option
    so all versions support this - <b>ne</b> can now do a
    "<b>@dos2unix</b>"</li>

    <li>[050225] Regular expressions - extended replacement string syntax.
    Added support for "<b>\c#</b>" "<b>\l#</b>" and "<b>\u#</b>" to change the
    case of groups, where "<b>\c#</b>" is capitalise, "<b>\l#</b>" is lower
    "<b>\u#</b>" is upper and "<b>#</b>" is the group number (<b>0-9</b>,
    <b>&amp;</b>)</li>

    <li>[050225] Regular expressions - changed syntax of "<b>\s?</b>" and
    "<b>\S?</b>" in favor of perl's simpler "<b>\s</b>" and "<b>\S</b>" for a
    whitespace char class. Added new character classes "<b>\d</b>" = digits,
    "<b>\D</b>" != digits "<b>\h</b>" = hexdigits "<b>\H</b>" != hexdigits
    "<b>\l</b>" = lowercase "<b>\L</b>" != lowercase "<b>\u</b>" = uppercase
    and "<b>\U</b>" != uppercase. These changes were made to both the main
    regex search engine and the <b>hilight(2)</b> token matching engine. Added
    support for char classes within the main regex <b>[...]</b> character
    class, i.e. now supports regexs like "<b>[\l\u_]</b>" for any lower, upper
    or '<b>_</b>' char. This is not supported in the hilight which currently
    has a more simplistic "<b>[...]</b>" char class support.</li>

    <li>[050225] Regular expressions - changed use of "<b>\s&nbsp;</b>",
    "<b>\s-</b>", "<b>\S&nbsp;</b>" and "<b>\S-</b>" classes to simply
    "<b>\s</b>" and "<b>\S</b>" which is perl regex compliant (ditching Emacs
    "<b>\s</b>" syntax as it is cumbersome and not very useful). The only
    nasty side effect is hilight's miss-use of "\<b>S1</b>" - "<b>\S9</b>" to
    mean not "<b>\1</b>" - "<b>\9</b>" group char, changed to "<b>\!1</b>" -
    "<b>\!9</b>"</li>

    <li>[050224] NE set to not auto-save or create backups by default.</li>

    <li>[050224] Added "<b>-a</b>" and "<b>-B</b>" command line options to
    enable and disable auto-save and backup modes.</li>

    <li>[050224] Tcl template - some more fixes to the item list from
    Detlef</li>

    <li>[050224] watch - improved the refresh rate of a type 2 or 3 watch by
    ignoring the <b>:watch time</b> and just look at the <b>:watch-size</b>.
    Fixed the split line issue with type 2 of 3 watching caused by last line
    not being complete.</li>

    <li>[050224] <b>M-x ftp</b> - stripped '<i>ftp://</i>' and any trailing
    '<i>/</i>' of the users entered host name as these break ftp. Improved the
    dialog's handling of passwords, the user can now tell if a password has
    been set.</li>

    <li>[050224] Added standard binding for mark-function</li>

    <li>[050224] Fixed the ME token hilighting in the C hook</li>

    <li>[050224] Removed recently added <b>%no_backup</b> variable to disable
    backup create as new <b>-B</b> option is a much better way of doing
    it.</li>

    <li>[050224] edef.h - Removed definition of non-existant variable</li>

    <li>[050224] Fixed failure when trying to load
    "<b>http://www.jasspa.com</b>", there is an implicit trailing '<b>/</b>'
    which MicroEmacs now adds.</li>

    <li>[050224] Tcl template - major improvement - courtesy of Detlef.</li>

    <li>[050224] Fixed collapse to support the file hooks <b>.exact</b>
    setting (set to -1 means case insensitive)</li>

    <li>[050224] Added new <b>beginning-of-function</b>,
    <b>end-of-function</b>, <b>goto-function-line</b> and <b>mark-function</b>
    macros - thanks to Detlef.</li>

    <li>[050223] Windows MS-dev 6 project - corrected project settings for
    <tt>_URLSUPP</tt> =&gre; <tt>_SOCKET</tt> in keeping with the socket
    dynamic library loading.</li>

    <li>[050223] Added exec of wish to the tcl magic hook</li>

    <li>[050223] Fixed <b>$window-chars</b> - added OSD default button
    chars.</li>

    <li>[050222] Fixed $user-path being more that 35 chars breaking the
    user-setup dialog.</li>

    <li>[050222] Directory listing - call fhook-html when file is a
    <b>http://</b> file - this is never a directory listing.</li>

    <li>[050222] Stopped loading of files in dir listing when clicking way to
    the right, must click on the name (ME kept loading files when just trying
    to raise the window to the front - annoying).</li>

    <li>[050222] If 0 given to watch call <b>watch-time</b>, this preserves
    the old interface.</li>

    <li>[050222] Added backup file disabling for "<b>dos2unix</b>" macros via
    command line defineable variable.</li>

    <li>[050221] Changed the new Windows process tree killing to use
    LoadLibrary() to detect whether the OS supports this feature (and NT does
    not). Also moved the URL support over to LoadLibrary() so we can remove
    the <b>-u</b> builds.</li>

    <li>[050220] Added UNIX Shell and Makefile hilighting to
    <b>notes(2)</b>.</li>

    <li>[050219] Fixed GNU GCC warnings in Makefiles for #pragma in X11 files
    under Sun Solaris and uninitialized variables.</li>

    <li>[050219] OSD. Removed dialog '<tt>F</tt>' flag as it was not
    documented, did not work and only used in one obscure place. Fixed
    <b>C-g</b> &amp; <b>Del</b> so they close up to the previous dialog but
    does close the main menu down in one call - was annoying.</li>

    <li>[050219] Release Candidate 1 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC1)</li>

    <li>[050218] Corrected UNIX client-server socket file check -- bad test on
    existence of connection file, using wrong variable with wrong test
    sense.</li>

    <li>[050218] Added site delete button to ftp-connect dialog.</li>

    <li>[050218] Fixed abbreviation and exec-string "<tt>\\p</tt>" and
    "<tt>\\P</tt>" store and goto position problem when the <b>C-x C-a</b> or
    <b>C-x a</b> keys are rebound. Fixed by replacing with '<tt>esc x
    set-alpha-mark P</tt>' (where <b>esc x</b> is a safe internal special
    key).</li>

    <li>[050218] Updated <b>watch</b> interface and made public. Created new
    <b>watch-time</b> command and prompt user for watch type when no argument
    is given.</li>

    <li>[050218] Removed the use of bit <tt>0x1000</tt> in ada string
    <b>hilight</b> as this is unlikely to be wanted (probably copied from
    Pascal).</li>

    <li>[050218] Changed the registry parser to abort on error rather than
    trying to carry on (a very painful process for a badly decrypted reg
    file)</li>

    <li>[050218] Fixed highlighting minor issues. Hilight scheme now returns
    back to <tt>EOL</tt> scheme after a bracket. A branch tag on an
    <tt>EOL</tt> line removes the <tt>EOL</tt> flag so it hilights correctly.
    Branch tag now supports the <tt>0x1000</tt> single line hilight. Lookback
    now supports <tt>0x800</tt> on a branch tag.</li>

    <li>[050217] HTML highlighting. Fixed some really grizzly scripted html
    page highlighting issues, predominantly with php.</li>

    <li>[050217] Change ftp so it opens the <b>ftp-connect</b> dialog if the
    current buffer is <tt>*ftp-files*</tt>.</li>

    <li>[050217] Fixed ftp dir list column detection and highlighting issue
    with windows ftp servers (time given as 9:15 not 09:15)</li>

    <li>[050217] Fixed bug in <b>set-variable</b> and <b>unset-variable</b>
    when <b>&amp;spr</b> is used to create a variable name.</li>

    <li>[050217] Watch command (<tt>watch.emf</tt>). Improved the watch
    command, made '<b>0 watch</b>' call <b>watch-reset</b>, changed
    watch-reset so with an argument of 0 it removes all watches otherwise it
    resets the main watch counter and reports to the user which buffers are
    watched. Added new '<b>2 watch</b>' &amp; '<b>3 watch</b>' which compares
    the file size, doing the following:

    <ul>

      <li>file on disk is smaller than last watch - reloads whole file</li>

      <li>file size is the same - does nothing</li>

      <li>file on disk is larger - appends to the end of the buffer the tail
      of the file (file_size - watch_file_size bytes)</li>

    </ul>

    This assumes that the files is always being appended (reasonable
    assumption in most cases. The only difference between 2 and 3 is that 2
    forces a complete reread of the file on the first file change (ensuring
    the buffer is correct), 3 does not which allows the user to trash the
    first gigabyte of the buffer before starting the watch.</li>

    <li>[050217] Shell template - added local and function keywords and fixed
    a few string highlighting problems.</li>

    <li>[050216] Made the dir-listing's (Filtered) label on line 2 pickable,
    changing the filter status when picked Made CVS's CVS-Quick label pickable
    doing a full reread when picked.</li>

    <li>[050216] Fixed a couple of silly register bugs introduced with last
    find-reg concatenate root and sub-key change. Improved behavior when ftp
    erf file is missing, now create a new one in memory and flags as changed
    so should be saved on exit.</li>

    <li>[050216] Do not abort me.emf execution if ftp erf file is missing or
    bad.</li>

    <li>[050216] Fixed by removing the 'startup' function, the main init now
    uses dofile directly and it checks for either a <tt>NULL</tt> or
    <tt>""</tt> as a filname and replaces with "<b>me</b>" or ("<b>ne</b>" and
    does not complain) if found to be empty. This means that give execute-file
    an empty string executes either "<b>me</b>" or "<b>ne</b>", i.e. resets me
    - nice side effect. Changed '<b>dofile()</b>' to <b>execFile()</b> and
    changed <b>execFile()</b> to <b>executeFile()</b> (as is function for
    command execute-file) and change the other exec command function names for
    consistency.</li>

    <li>[050216] Fixed an annoyance reported by Bruno, ne should not complain
    if it fails to find <tt>ne.emf</tt> - fair enough.</li>

    <li>[050215] Fixed crash caused by using <b>-c</b> option with all files
    hidden (comment when browsing ftp dirs as cache dir lists are hidden) The
    startup process knows the history created buffers but the replacement was
    none of these and due to the tool-bar it was a buffer without a file name
    and bang! Fixed in 2 ways, first check the replacement has a file name,
    second do not put hidden files into the history - they're hidden.</li>

    <li>[050210] Improved movement between items using the cursor in the
    search dialog.</li>

    <li>[050210] Fixed cvs dialog default settings</li>

    <li>[050210] Corrected search path expansion, incorrectly handling a
    <tt>PATH_CHAR</tt> at the start of the string.</li>

    <li>[050209] Up-dated user-setup platform page to new style and added yank
    rectangle binding.</li>

    <li>[050209] Fixed no-color termcap <b>$window-char</b> variable
    setting</li>

    <li>[050209] Fixed hot keys (were 3 'U's) in osdmisc.emf</li>

    <li>[050209] Added new BraceStatement indent value to support GNU C
    indentation style.</li>

    <li>[050209] Fixed the osdDisp() function required a TTflush otherwise the
    cursor is left in the wrong position on termcap systems.</li>

    <li>[050209] Fixed the default <b>$window-char</b> variable setting.</li>

    <li>[050209] Fixed the DOS home directory setting and compiler
    warnings.</li>

    <li>[050208] Changed the C indent definition to be the same format as the
    existing indent definitions i.e. uses flag &amp; indent value, this makes
    it more flexible and extendible. Updated macro files.</li>

    <li>[050205] Password generation macros added to contrib directory.</li>

    <li>[050205] Added JavaDoc highlighting to Java template. Enablement via
    buffer-setup. Removed the existing "<b>my</b>" extensions from
    contrib.</li>

    <li>[050205] Added Doxygen, &lt;stdint.h&gt; and error highlighting to
    C/C++ templates. Enablement via buffer-setup. Removed the existing
    "<b>my</b>" extensions from contrib.</li>

    <li>[050204] osd - Fixed problems with the '<i>cursor shows current
    item</i>' feature of osd caused by the cursor position going outside of
    the window.</li>

    <li>[050202] Added an initial item number to the favorite and buffer
    menus.</li>

    <li>[050203] Standardized narrow anchor and line flag movement behaviors
    with respect to deleting and inserting text. Enforced to effectively exist
    at character column -1 and been strict about maintaining a protected line.
    Made undo cope with markup lines that are lost. These changes may be a
    little to severe - we'll see.</li>

    <li>[050202] Fixed <tt>C-g</tt> close osd dialog crash.</li>

    <li>[050202] Directory listing - fixed nasty bug cause by the directory
    changing on disk before the hook has managed to do anything leading to a
    failure - this has been annoying Jon for some time!</li>

    <li>[050127] <tt>hkemf.emf</tt> - Fixed <b>!until</b> indent rule</li>

    <li>[050127] First revision of "<b>notes</b>".</li>

    <li>[050127] Fixed positional problems with mouse rectangle regions and
    added a mouse rectangle yank to user-setup.</li>

    <li>[050127] CVS - Set the initial osd dialog item to be the first item
    rather than the Okay button (with is still the default button).</li>

    <li>[050127] Fixed <b>*scratch*</b> hook assignment issues, initial
    startup buffer and only buffer delete problem.</li>

    <li>[050127] Added process tree killing for windows, tested on win98, 2k
    &amp; XP, would be good to test on win95 (which should work) and NT which
    should not work but hopefully will be no worse than current version.<br/>
    This is a process tree killing for ipipes, in win32 killing the process we
    create is simply not good enough, all child processes continue unaffected.
    For example, run compile, kill the buffer in mid compile and it carries on
    behind your back!<br/> For Unix we use a new group and kill the group, DOS
    does not support ipipe. We could have used the new Job concept in ME but
    this is only present in win2000 &amp; XP and the binaries are unlikely to
    run on win98 etc. This should run on every win32 platform although it is
    unlikely to do anything positive on an NT box (works in win2k)</li>

    <li>[050126] Changed the location of the fhook-default macro so its only
    defined if using buffinit (i.e. if running main me.emf)</li>

    <li>[050126] Fixed osd button repeat issue when current focus is an
    entry.</li>

    <li>[050126] Changed "<b>insert-file-name</b>" to insert buffer name if a
    -ve arg is given, bound to C-x y, this replaces ml-lines esc y
    feature.</li>

    <li>[050123] Fixed a crash caused by too many closed fences, the recursive
    nature of the findfence() function triggers a stack crash at around 22000
    on windows. Set limit to 256 nested fences.</li>

    <li>[050122] Fixed "<b>dir</b>" mode loss on a directory re-read, this
    caused a number of side effects including loss of highlighting and user
    prompt to reload the directory when it had changed.</li>

    <li>[050119] Removed the "<b>sub-key</b>" argument from all registry
    related calls ("<b>&amp;reg</b>" and "<b>set-registry</b>"). The registry
    calls used to comprise two arguments "<b>root</b>" and "<b>sub-key</b>",
    the "<b>sub-key</b>" is really redundant and the same effect may be
    achieved by a simple string concatenation of the "<b>sub-key</b>" to the
    "<b>root</b>".</li>

    <li>[050119] Added "<b>my-*hook-always</b>" macro checks in the buffer
    hook switching to permit global file hooks to be defined, this allows a
    file hook to operate on all buffers. "<b>my-*hook-always</b>" is executed
    after the language file hooks of "<b>*hook-XXX</b>" and
    "<b>my-*hook-XXX</b>".</li>

    <li>[050116] Added "<b>TODO</b>" highlighting rule for Makefile
    comments.</li>

    <li>[050114] Fixed <b>narrow(2)</b> type numeric argument not processed
    correctly.</li>

    <li>[050113] Added toolbar tool mouse select region command.</li>

    <li>[050113] Added bindings for the cvs and ftp console tools.</li>

    <li>[050113] Fixed <b>organizer(3)</b> duplicate index bug.</li>

    <li>[050111] Deleted the <b>get-registry(2)</b> command, this has been
    depreciated and <b>&amp;reg</b> should be used instead.</li>

    <li>[050111] Extended the <b>read-registry(2)</b> and
    <b>save-registry(2)</b> commands to permit reading and writing from a
    buffer based registry (rather than file).</li>

    <li>[050111] Extended <b>list-registry(2)</b> to permit listing of
    specific nodes, the output buffer of the registry listing may be
    specified. Added a invisible flag to a registry node which hides the node
    completely (but can be toggled).</li>

    <li>[050111] Fixed windows server cmd file polling of up to 60 times a
    second by making the adder of the command responsible for 'waking' ME by
    sending a WM_USER message. This is not a problem for UNIX as it is
    possible to wait on file input and EOF is not reported.</li>

    <li>[050105] Fixed several narrow-to usability issues, with these fixes
    the top and bottom narrow cannot be removed without a markup line and the
    order cannot get muddled.</li>

    <li>[050105] Fixed a problem with the anchor position up-date when
    inserting a whole line.</li>

    <li>[050105] Changed the osd entry mouse handling to always refocus, this
    allows the user to change location in the current entry using the
    mouse.</li>

    <li>[050105] Fixed. insert-macro undo location was incorrect causing a
    crash.</li>

    <li>[050103] Spelling dialog. Changed the Ignore button to Continue if
    word becomes correct without changing (word added or language
    changed).</li>

    <li>[050103] Fixed. CVS osd dialog with bad hot-key.</li>

    <li>[050102] Added setting of <b>$recent-keys</b> variable.</li>

    <li>[041231] Variable "<b>$fmatchdelay</b>" renamed to
    "<b>$pause-time</b>". The "<b>$pause-time</b>" is now used for other
    MicroEmacs delay times when the user is prompted for information.</li>

    <li>[041224] Fixed several usability issues in the search replace
    dialog.</li>

    <li>[041224] Up-graded printer-setup dialog to new style OSD.</li>

    <li>[041224] CVS dialog - added read-only option to checkout and
    update.</li>

    <li>[041224] Fixed goto-line offset which as always going to the previous
    line (one out).</li>

    <li>[041221] Added support for proper kill buffer use in message line,
    i.e. set-mark, kill-region, copy-region, yank and reyank all work in the
    same way as a normal buffer.</li>

    <li>[041221] Fixed registry node deletion when the node is modified.</li>

    <li>[041221] Removed osd 0 'd' flag and added 'I' initial item and 'D'
    default button flags, existing osd dialogs which use 'd' will fail to load
    and need are migrated to use the D and I flags.</li>

    <li>[041218] auto-spell key bindings are promoted to global so its easy to
    enable in any buffer.</li>

    <li>[041218] Corrected setting of the $home environment variable to handle
    MS-Windows '\\'s, auto terminate with '/'.</li>

    <li>[041210] Added Enable/Disable Auto-Spell to the context menu.</li>

    <li>[041210] Rearranged the organizer dialog to be a little easier to
    navigate through.</li>

    <li>[041210] Fixed nedit emulation insert binding.</li>

    <li>[041210] Removed "<b>ml-clear</b>" command, replaced with "<b>0
    ml-write</b>".</li>

    <li>[041210] Removed the change-directory commands, a change in directory
    is achieved by changing the "<b>$buffer-fname</b>" value such that the
    path defines the location of the command. All macros operated relative to
    the buffer location and never explicitly changed the directory
    location.</li>

    <li>[041210] Fixed CUA emulation insert binding.</li>

    <li>[041210] Deleted letter(2m) mode. Use the default binding of
    "<b>forward-delete-char</b>" for letter mode off, where single deleted
    characters are to be added to the kill buffer then the existing letter(2m)
    mode may be achieved by binding as "<b>1 forward-delete-char</b>".
    Similarly for backspace, "<b>backward-delete-char</b>".</li>

    <li>[041210] Deleted line(2m) mode. Use a binding of "<b>1 kill-line</b>"
    to mimic the line(2m) mode enabled and "<b>kill-line</b>" for line(2m)
    mode disabled.</li>

    <li>[041210] Deleted cmode(2m). Electric-c is now configured with
    indent(2). C and C++ indent styles can be different, can also have a GNU C
    style etc, can change the indent width as new indent rule supports 't',
    consistent $buffer-indent interface.</li>

    <li>[041210] Created new osd file "<b>osdmisc.emf</b>" for miscellaneous
    OSD macros, this removes the OSD dependency when the MicroEmacs is
    executed in special start up modes with startup files. Moved search and
    new indent-setup commands out of "<b>search.emf</b>" and
    "<b>format.emf</b>" into a new "<b>osdmisc.emf</b>" as they cause problems
    with utils that do not run "<b>me.emf</b>" (e.g.
    "<b>ehftools.emf</b>")</li>

    <li>[041210] Introduced a GNU emacs emulation mode, emulation file is
    "<b>meemacs.emf</b>".</li>

    <li>[041209] Fixed newuser "<b>$user-name.emf</b>" conflict issue with an
    existing macro (e.g. zaurus.emf) by testing for it and prefixing a digit
    to make the file unique.</li>

    <li>[041209] Added esc C-\\ binding to restyle-buffer.</li>

    <li>[041209] Fixed some issues with the Tools user-setup dialog.</li>

    <li>[041128] Added MinGW makefile posted to JASSPA group, forms part of
    the release makefiles.</li>

    <li>[041126] Added 'k' keyboard setup to set-char-mask which is used to
    translates foreign keys to a latin char.</li>

    <li>[041126] Changed the internal LEADER byte to 0x1c as 0xff is a valid
    Russian char and it badly breaks $vars and macros.</li>

    <li>[041126] Fixed spell dump word which was not translating the words to
    the users char-set.</li>

    <li>[041126] Added support for Russian language.</li>

    <li>[041126] Improved the aff ispell conversion routines (almost works
    automatically).</li>

    <li>[041126] Stopped auto-spell from triggering the no dictionaries error,
    leave it to spell-buffer etc.</li>

    <li>[041125] Fixed OSD multi-line C-k kill-line behavior and implemented
    <b>-1 kill-line</b> support.</li>

    <li>[041125] Added basic support for Verilog programming language.</li>

    <li>[041123] Fixed ftp OSD (auto entering entries broke the password
    field) and modernized.</li>

    <li>[041028] Fixed. <b>*find*</b> buffer exhibits the same behavior as
    <b>*grep*</b> buffer. i.e. the <b>*find*</b> buffer remains on screen and
    a pop-up window is used to show the file.</li>

    <li>[041028] Fixed. *grep* buffer does not load file when selected with
    &lt;RETURN&gt;.</li>

    <li>[041027] Spruced up old "<b>apache.conf</b>" highlighting rules and
    added to release.</li>

    <li>[041022] Fixed very obscure cvs load-up bug.</li>

    <li>[041122] Updated schemes to set 'Show cursor in osd' suitably and to
    make sure the cursor is not red as this conflicts with the match fence
    display.</li>

    <li>[041120] Fixed transpose-line crash when undo mode is disabled.</li>

    <li>[041120] Removed the OSD explicit tab order value as this was not
    constructively used and causes many item order problems.</li>

    <li>[041119] Many improvements to OSD dialog user interface following
    suggestions for news group. Updated most of the osd dialogs to use the new
    [*] checkbox chars. Fixed tabbing orders and moved some items over to
    combo-boxes. Added osd-cursor visibility support to scheme-edit. Made the
    displaying of the cursor in an osd dialog a $system bit set by the hilight
    scheme and fixed the position when in a child dialog.</li>

    <li>[041118] Added a macro recursion depth limit of 20 to avoid blowing up
    ME when the user has created an infinitely recursive macro.</li>

    <li>[041112] Added Paul Boekholt's suggested GNU Emacs key bindings.</li>

    <li>[041107] kill-paragraph, fill-paragraph, forward-paragraph and
    backward-paragraph commands redefined. kill-paragraph now kills forward
    and backward rather than control the kill buffer. Paragraph movement now
    defined blank-line to blank-line rather than the first/last paragraph
    line.</li>

    <li>[041105] Fixed kill-lines and kill-word numerical argument
    implementation.</li>

    <li>[041104] Removed "<b>regex-forward</b>" and "<b>regex-backward</b>"
    macros and moved uses of them over to search-buffer.</li>

    <li>[041104] Added "<b>search-buffer</b>" command which replaces the macro
    commands "<b>regex-forward</b>" and "<b>regex-backward</b>". Simplifies
    macro processing of searching by providing a search that explicitly sets
    the "<b>exact</b>" and "<b>magic</b>" modes. The default is to repect
    buffers exact and magic mode and flags must have E or M to ensure they are
    disabled.</li>

    <li>[041104] Changed any use of "<b>kill-line</b>" to "<b>1 kill-line</b>"
    as this should maintain its required behavior. A "<b>kill-line</b>" with
    no numeric argument kills to the end of the line but excludes the end of
    line character (GNU Emacs compatibility). The default binding is the "<b>1
    kill-line</b>" form, re-bind the key to "<b>kill-line</b>" if the end of
    line is not to be killed.</li>

    <li>[041104] Removed line and letter buffer modes as these can be done
    using numerical arguments to bindings. See the the "<b>kill-line</b>"
    binding which replaces line mode. See "<b>forward-delete-char</b>" and
    "<b>backward-delete-char</b>" binding which replaces letter mode.</li>

    <li>[041104] Changed the "<b>kill-word</b>" commands to be more consistent
    with GNU Emacs.</li>

    <li>[041102] Moved winterm over to using addKeyToBufferOnce() for mouse
    move and time, also done same for UNIX mouse time event. This minimizes
    the number of mouse moved events that are processed by the system.</li>

    <li>[041101] MS Windows. Fixed mouse cursor disappearing after using a
    Shift or Control mouse button event.</li>

    <li>[041101] Auto reload the directory even if it is changed
    (hkdirlst.emf).</li>

    <li>[041030] MS-Windows. Removed the "<b>WM_INPUTLANGCHANGE</b>" message
    handler as this did the wrong thing (use Alt-Shift to change between 2
    different keyboards e.g. US and Russian)</li>

    <li>[041030] MS-Windows. Changed the method used to get the APPDATA path
    to use SHGetSpecialFolderLocation() as this is available in all versions
    of Windows.</li>

    <li>[041030] UNIX. Fixed the mouse movement which caused a rendering
    anomaly. Mouse moved commands are only added to the key buffer if the key
    is not already present in the key queue. This alleviates a large build up
    of redundant mouse move keys on the queue. (Added function
    addKeyToBufferOnce())</li>

    <li>[041030] Added mouse rectangle region selection methods,
    copy-rectangle and kill-rectangle.</li>

    <li>[041029] Hardened C++ commenting on // alignment when the previous
    line is a solid ////////// when re-styling buffer.</li>

    <li>[041029] Fixed "<b>*find*</b>" buffer operation so that it operates
    like *grep* on file selection. Keyboard file section enabled within the
    "<b>*grep*</b>" and "<b>*find*</b>" buffer.</li>

    <li>[041029] Added Apache configuration file highlighting rules.</li>

    <li>[041026] Spruced up old "<b>smb.conf</b>" highlighting rules, brought
    them up to date with latest keywords and added to release.</li>

    <li>[041026] Fixed indent-setup osd dialog.</li>

    <li>[041024] Macro/source compatibility macro and source versions updated
    to "<b>20041001</b>".</li>

    <li>[041024] Fixed the cvs-diff options, local with HEAD was not
    correct.</li>

    <li>[041024] Latex template extended. Buffer bindings for underscore and
    quote keys. Search tools to determine current context.</li>

    <li>[041023] Extended the buffer setup for the indent mechanism. May now
    specify the default buffer indent-width and tab-size in the buffer setup
    dialog.</li>

    <li>[041022] Revised indentation implementation. The templates now define
    indent width independent rules. The indent commend 'indent' parameter may
    be defined as an absolute indentation or using a 't' notation. The syntax
    is "<b>[-][[indent][/indent]]t</b>" which defines a vulgar fration of 't'
    which is the indent width (or tabsize) as specified by
    "<b>$buffer-indent-width</b>" defined below.<br/>

    The global variables "<b>$tabsize</b>" renamed "<b>$indent-width</b>" and
    controls the global indentation size. "<b>$tabwidth</b>" renamed
    "<b>$tab-width</b>" and controls the display size of a literal TAB
    character.<br/>

    The indentation is now specified on a buffer basis, the variables
    "<b>$buffer-indent-width</b>" and "<b>$buffer-tab-width</b>" define the
    indentation and TAB width on a per buffer basis. These are seeded from the
    aforementioned global variables.</li>

    <li>[041022] Fixed spelling mistake in user interface of XML macros.</li>

    <li>[041022] Removed CVS "<b>Log:</b>" field from all of the template
    files - undesirable.</li>

    <li>[041022] Added HTTP highlighting to the text document template.</li>

    <li>[041021] Enhanced Wiki language template.</li>

    <li>[041021] Added Windows CUA emulation mode.</li>

    <li>[041019] Fixed insert binding for Nedit emulation mode</li>

    <li>[041019] Fixed perl highlighting rules. Using incorrect syntax.</li>

    <li>[041016] Fixed UNIX make files for building NE in debug mode.</li>

    <li>[041016] Fixed termcap entry for ^@ key (C-space). (Thanks to Bob
    Paddock for noting ommission)</li>

    <li>[041016] Added M-% binding to query-replace as built in binding.
    (Thanks to Bob Paddock)</li>

    <li>[041016] Added Ruby programming language support.</li>

    <li>[041015] Corrected problem with directory listing loosing highlighting
    (@mna problem).</li>

    <li>[041014] Within OSD, fixed spelling mistake. Loose -&gt; Lose</li>

    <li>[041014] Fixed delete-hilight-lines failure when buffer file has
    changed.</li>

    <li>[041009] Fixed osd entry scheme as the cursor was not visible in MS
    Dev-Studio Colors.</li>

    <li>[041009] Added Wiki language template</li>

    <li>[041003] Wheel mouse binding added as default.</li>

    on the reserved fields to sort. <tt>BACKSPACE</tt> now moves up a
    directory level.</li>

    <li>[040322] Changed the interface to cvs, ftp and file-browser command so

    <li>[040310] Fix to graphical diff (<b>gdiff</b>). Occasions where all
    changes had been accepted and the changes could not be saved. <b>gdiff</b>
    incorrectly prompted user to accept all changes first.</li>

    <li>[040310] Support for multiple comment styles in the same language
    template. Additional comment styles are defined in the <tt>hkXXX.emf</tt>
    file with the syntax <tt>.fhook-XXX.comment-N</tt> where <tt>N</tt> is an
    integer starting for <tt>1</tt> to <tt>n</tt>, the number of different
    comment styles. Templates updated to use multiple comment styles where
    appropriate (C, C++ and SQL).</li>

    <li>[040310] Support the <b>r</b> flag in <tt>.fhook-XXX.comment</tt> flag
    field. Causes the key binding to <b>esc-o</b> and <b>esc-q</b> to restyle
    the comment. All templates updated to include the flag where
    appropriate.</li>

    <li>[040310] CVS operates asynchronously using ipipes. Refresh problems

    <li>[040308] <b>ipipe-shell-command</b> includes additional flag to run in
    <i>raw mode</i> where the buffer is not annotated and wrap is disabled.
    Additional argument added to command to allow the <b>$buffer-ipipe</b>
    macro to be defined when the pipe is defined. Corrected operation of

    <i>pipe</i> (Windows only), if degraded then the <b>$buffer-ipipe</b>
    macro is still invoked on completion.</li>

    <li>[040226] Deleted <tt>cygnus.emf</tt> added <tt>cygwin.emf</tt> for

    Created new <b>context-menu</b> command, bound to <tt>S-f1</tt> and the
    windows <tt>menu</tt> key (aka windows) and created binds to open main
    menu (<tt>esc&nbsp;=</tt>) and context menu (<tt>esc&nbsp;+</tt>) on
    termcap platforms.</li>

    <li>[040217] Fixed. <tt>2&nbsp;popup-window</tt> does not work on an

    <li>[040217] Fixed. CVS status of directories is not shown. Also add
    <b>b</b> and <b>o</b> file type flags.</li>

    <li>[040216] Fixed. <tt>build.bat&nbsp;-l</tt> options do not work in
    standard cmd/command as they use 4DOS <tt>&gt;&gt;&amp;</tt> extension.
    Changed to using <tt>2&gt;&amp;1</tt> which works on <b>cmd</b> and
    <b>4nt</b> but breaks <b>4Dos</b> and <b>command</b>.</li>

    <li>[040216] Fixed bottom Toolbar window grows when CVS is opened,
    <b>change-window-depth</b> does not respect bit 2 of
    <b>$window-flags</b>.</li>

    <li>[040214] Added <tt>.spec</tt> template for RedHat RPM package file

    <li>[040213] PHP script can be started with <tt>&lt;?</tt> tag in a php
    file.</li>

    <li>[040213] Corrected UNIX ishell operation when <b>su</b> to another
    user. Locking up or generally behaving badly (termio not initialized).
    Affects all UNIX platforms.</li>

    <li>[040213] Documented the <b>create</b>/<b>delete</b>/<b>next-frame</b>
    keys.</li>

    <li>[040210] Fixed toolbar Directory File List does not contain
    <tt>../</tt> - UNIX only.</li>

    <li>[040210] Fixed. On UNIX only the <b>$progname</b> may not be fully
    expanded (has just <b>me</b>) which may lead to a <i>ctags</i> generation
    error and an alternate fix to <b>$search-path</b>.</li>

    <li>[040210] Fixed. On UNIX, <b>find-file</b> of a symbolic link which
    points to a directory results in a bad directory listing. The list of
    files is correct but the stats are all wrong (found on sunos 5.8).</li>

    <li>[040210] Fix subtle ftp bug with alias ftp addressed. Create an ftp
    site <tt>ftp://test/</tt> say with user name foo and passwd bar and then
    load in <tt>ftp://test/dir1/</tt> the buffer file name is correctly set as
    <tt>ftp://test/dir1/</tt> but the <i>Directory listing of:</i> line is set
    to <tt>ftp://foo@test/dir1/</tt>. Firstly the user may wish the
    <tt>foo</tt> to be hidden but secondly with the introduction of being able
    to click on the <i>Directory listing of:</i> line this has introduced a
    subtle inefficiency/bug, if I click on the <tt>foo@test</tt> ME will load
    <tt>ftp://foo@test/</tt> not <tt>ftp://test/</tt> which to ME is a
    completely different file. This can in turn lead to
    <tt>ftp://foo@test/dir1/</tt> being loaded so you can end up with 2 copies
    of every dir being loaded! The fix is to make the <i>Directory listing
    of:</i> line the same, i.e. <tt>ftp://test/dir1/</tt></li>

    <li>[040208] Fixed. <b>-n</b> command line option to a console build
    causes a option failure and the executable does not run.</li>

    <li>[040208] Corrected UNIX jasspa tree search when executable is in CWD
    and there is no executable path.</li>

    <li>[040206] <b>RC4 - Release Candidate 4 - MicroEmacs '04</b></li>

    <li>[040206] Fixes for tool-bar Buffer Item List update problem. Thanks to
    Dr. Detlef Groth.</li>

    <li>[040206] Added template support for XML. Thanks to Dr. Detlef
    Groth.</li>

    <li>[040204] Re-worked Microsoft Windows <tt>me32.ini</tt> file
    specification. Order revised and lookup simplified.</li>

    <li>[040203] <b>user-setup</b> changed name to <i>Rebind Home Keys</i> for
    re-binding of <tt>home</tt> and <tt>end</tt> keys to start/end of line.
    Removed <tt>C-v</tt> binding that existed with old <i>MS keys</i>
    label.</li>

    <li>[040203] Reworked all user defined defined directory save locations,
    ftp, spell, etc..</li>

    <li>[040203] Corrected osf1, openBSD and zaraus emf files.</li>

    <li>[040203] Added <b>%cvs-com</b> variable to define the CVS
    command.</li>

    <li>[040203] XML template extended to include javascript.</li>

    <li>[040130] 2nd iteration of prototype and near final revision of new
    user setup.<ul>

      <p>Following an internal review of RC3 then it has been decided to
      address the issues of user configuration prior to a full release. This
      specifically addresses the location of user MicroEmacs configuration
      directories and search paths. User configuration has traditionally
      required the setting of external environment variables such as
      <tt>$MEPATH</tt> and for the user to create a private directory to store
      user settings. This is proving difficult for new users who just want to
      run the editor. RC4 and subsequent releases will address these problems
      by determining the correct location for configuration files and create
      the appropriate files and directories under user control.</p>

      <p>The net result of these  changes  should  significantly  simplify
      installation and setup as follows:</p>

      <li>All platforms will be able to run without any manual user setup or
      the requirement for specific MicroEmacs environment variables.</li>

      <li>User  defined  directories  and  configuration  files  will  be
      created under editor control on detecting a new user.</li>

      <li>Existing installations using <tt>$MEPATH</tt> will be backwards
      compatible with the new build.</li>

      <li>All platforms now support a searching jasspa sub-directory structure
      of <tt>company</tt>, <tt>spelling</tt> and <tt>macros</tt>. This was
      traditionally limited to the Windows Install Shield installation but has
      been extended across all platforms.</li>

      <li>Two new environment variables are provided for user or system
      administrator use. <tt>$MEINSTALLPATH</tt> defines the location of the
      MicroEmacs standard macros and allows the built in search path to be
      overridden. <tt>$MEUSERPATH</tt> defines the location of the user
      private configuration directory and allows the user to locate their
      private directory in different location. In a standard install neither
      of these variables will be required.</li>

      <li>The Microsoft Windows system defined application path will be used
      for user configuration files. This is applicable for roaming users where
      the application directory is stored on a server.</li>

      <li>The use of the <tt>me32.ini</tt> file on MicroSoft Windows
      environments is not required, but is still supported.</li>

      <li>The UNIX path searching is improved. <tt>/usr/local/microemacs</tt>
      will be depreciated and replaced with <tt>/usr/local/jasspa</tt> in
      addition other standard path locations are supported on a per-platform
      basis.</li>

      <li>On UNIX then the directory <tt>~/.jasspa</tt> shall contain the user
      configuration files. Optionally the <tt>company</tt>, <tt>spelling</tt>
      <tt>macros</tt> sub-directories may be included in this directory where
      access to the system directory locations by the user is not
      permitted.</li>

      <li>Concept of <i>guest</i> has been removed. <tt>guest.emf</tt> and
      <tt>guest.erf</tt> removed replaced with <tt>newuser</tt>.
      <b>user-setup</b> no longer supports setting of name.</li>

      <li>Internal variables <tt>$user-name</tt> and <tt>$user-path</tt> are
      defined.</li>

    </ul></li>

    <li>[040128] Fixed re-style for C/C++ comments in vertical
    alignment.</li>

    <li>[040123] <b>user-setup</b> mouse button selection fixed.</li>

    narrowing. Renamed most function in line.c to make them more
    readable.</li>

    for win32 & unix. The *-lock implementation to be more like S-pick and
    C-pick as the keys are automatically supported (like the shift) so there
    are no default binds to void, the keys are only generated if there are
    bound. Could not implement this on DOS.</li>

    <li>[011016] <b>which</b> command built in i.e. &quot;M-x which&quot;.
    Used for command utilities.</li>

    <li>[011026] A new Hide value feature when inputting strings, this is now
    used be the crypt and ftp Password entry. The string is shown as
    '*'s.</li>

    <li>[011025] Utilised the latest screen-update improvements to make the
    gdiff screen update rock solid.</li>

    <li>[011025] mlGetChar fix. The key &quot;return&quot; was the 78th
    special char, i.e. SKEY_SPEC|'N' and as the mlGetChar did not check the
    SKEY_SPEC bits, pressing return was like pressing 'N' so on a Y/N prompt
    try pressing return, its like saying No! .</li>

    <li>[011016] Spelling dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because
    of the language changes, you need to rename your personal dictionary to
    <tt>lsdpengb.edf</tt> for British and <tt>lsdpenus.edf</tt> for
    American.</li>

    <li>[011016] Hilighting brackets/braces as requested from user base. The
    hilight braces required some other subtle changes to screen-update and
    <b>show-region</b> and the addition of the rbin mode means that this
    version is incompatible with the last in quite a few areas.</li>

    <li>[011016] Fixed mouse handler (turns out that if the pick event was
    lost (use @cg or an error) then me would lock!).</li>

    <li>[011016] Extended control on indent tab and return behaviour (can
    disable the tab behaviour).</li>

    <li>[011016] C++ namespace indentation support.</li>

    <li>[011016] New language support interface so spelling is not required
    for a language to be supported (may only want the basic alphabet setup
    etc).</li>

    <li>[011016] Changed file loading interface so all commands (like
    <b>view-file</b>) can load in bin,crypt or rbin mode.</li>

    <li>[010123] Reduced binary mode added (rbin).</li>

  </ul>

    close).</li>

    <li>[010810] Rendered character for the scroll bar - improves clarity.</li>

    <li>[010810] Modified the printer registry file location.</li>

    <li>[010716] Minor macros modification to font selection for schemes.
    Default guest setup font selection for cleaner 'first' page.</li>

    <li>[010716] CVS macro update. Changed <tt>cvs-diff</tt> to
    <tt>cvs-gdiff</tt> and introduced a new <tt>cvs-diff</tt> which just gives
    the <i>diff</i> output and fixed several bugs when running with a cvs
    server. Also added support for the CVS/Template file when committing.</li>

    <li>[010716] Minor update to the CVS help page for the aforementioned
    (Affected all help files).</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>3rd Release - July 2001</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>[010713] New style WWW JASSPA Pages.</li>

    <li>[010712] Added comment and menu support for <i>dos</i> and <i>m4</i>
    (hkdos.emf/hkm4.emf).</li>

    <li>[010711] Added hpux11 support.</li>

    <li>[010711] Fixed windows erase when file doesn't exist problems.</li>

    <li>[010710] Removed cbox - replaced by generic comment implementation
    (cbox.emf/me.ehf).</li>

    <li>[010710] Added a 'Plain Text' char set which only uses plain letters
    (charset.emf).</li>

    <li>[010710] Fixed many little comment formatting bugs and annoyances
    (comment.emf).</li>

    <li>[010710] Changes required to build on dos using DJGPP v1.</li>

    <li>[010705] Bug fix for windows rendering crash.</li>

    <li>[010630] Minor reorder to X-Windows initialisation for cygwin
    X-Server.</li>

    <li>[010507] Added generic commands for the creation, deletion and
    reformatting of comments now used by most of the file hooks.</li>

    <li>[010412] Added new generic buffer setup, menu and help macros,
    creating the <b>new buffer-setup(3)</b> command. Ported all existing file
    hooks to this new interface greatly reducing the buffer hook size while
    increasing its functionality and consistency.</li>

    <li>[010402] Added support for new <b>$buffer-backup(5)</b> variable for
    setting the back-up file location.</li>

    <li>[010312] Support for new key bindings allowing CU emulations. Nedit
    bindings provided as example. Major work to enable the complete rebinding
    of all keys so the user interface to MicroEmacs can be completely changed,
    this allows for example a Windows feel to be created. This required many
    internal ghosts to be exorcised and add new macro functions.</li>

    <li>[010308] User buffer configuration menu added.</li>

    <li>[010308] Improved Python support (Contribution PG).</li>

    for user dependent completion, used in gdiff.</li>

    <li>[010202] Changed buffer variables to except the form
    <tt>:&lt;buffer-name&gt;:&lt;variable&gt;</tt>, like command variables.
    This allows macros to access variable not defined in the current
    buffer.</li>

    <li>[010126] File autosave location changes. Control save name and
    location.</li>

    <li>[001005] OSD speedups.</li>

    <li>[001005] Improved and increased the file system operations via the new
    file-op(2) command, created better menus in the file-browser(3).</li>

    <li>[001010] Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more
    rationally.</li>

    <li>[001010] Improved ipipe-shell-command efficiency on Windows by
    introducing a new thread approach to listen for activity. Implemented a
    shell command-line in an ipiped environment so ishell(3) command is now
    usable on Windows platforms.</li>

    <li>[001010] Added new set-position(2) which can be used to store all
    information about the current window and goto-position(2) which will then
    restore them. Allowed macros to use non-letter characters for alpha marks
    and positions so they no longer need to clobber user ones.</li>

    <li>[001010] Added new -k and -u command-line options and improved -s
    option.</li>

    <li>[000922] Added GUI for tag dialogue for tags generation.</li>

    traversal).</li>

    <li>[000810] <tt>emain.h</tt> <tt>#define</tt>'s properly supported again
    so MicroEmacs can be successfully compiled without options like SPELL and
    OSD etc. This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%.</li>

    <li>[000718] Source trees now maintained under CVS.</li>

    <li>[000719] Improved TCL/TK and Perl template support.</li>

    <li>[000704] Improved FTP and HTTP support.</li>

    <li>[000620] Java tags support.</li>

    <li>[000503] Revised printer support.</li>

    <li>[000503] Color printer support (Lexmark).</li>

    <li>[000322] Support for Openstep 4.2 / NeXT Motorola 040 (Termcap only).</li>

    <li>[000322] Support for BSD 4.2/4.3.</li>

    <li>[000322] Revised UNIX Termcap support.</li>

    <li>[000322] New font rendering, supporting bold, italic, underline etc. All
    platforms modified to cope with font scheme definitions. Platforms optimised
    for speed.</li>

    <li>[000126] Beta build revision contains version information for
    2000/01/26.</li>

    <li>[000126] Directory file copy. Within this release files in the
    directory listings may be selected for copy and pasting from the menu. Use
    the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory buffers. Copy and
    paste to/from a <i>ftp</i> directory buffer to a <i>local</i> drive buffer
    may be used to initiate an ftp transfer. (This is how these pages are
    uploaded).</li>

    <li>[000126] New command <b>ftp</b> opens a <i>ftp</i> connection using a
    dialog. Use may save the host connection information in a registry file.
    <i>Note that the password information is exposed so be careful where this
    is used - if in doubt do not enter the password and you will be
    prompted</i>.</li>

    <li>[000126] New command <b>uniq</b> operates as the <tt>UNIX</tt> of the
    same name. used with <b>sort,</b> and reduces to unique lines.</li>

    <li>[000126] Character translation; addition of character translation
    macros when moving between character sets. Accessible from <b>Menu -&gt;
    Format -&gt; Change Buffer Char Set</b>.</li>

    <li>[000126] Support for additional character sets, Windows GREEK, Windows
    TURKISH.</li>

    <li>[000126] Line hilighting selection with the use of the mouse and auto
    search. When using the mouse selection to set up the line hilighting when
    invoked from a

    <p>
    <ul>
      right-mouse -&gt; Hilight Line -&gt; <i>color/remove</i>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>selection. The macro determines the mouse selected region and makes an
    appropriate decision as to how the line hilighting scheme is to be
    applied. The following rules apply to the mouse selection:-</p>

    <ul>

      <li><b>Point in line selected (i.e. mark == point)</b>

      <br/>Hilight the line only.</li>

      <li><b>Region in the line selected. Both point and mark are on the same
      line.</b>

      <br/>Extract the selected text and hilight all lines that match the
      search pattern. The color &quot;remove&quot; is also pattern matched to
      selectively remove lines.</li>

      <li><b>Region selected mark & point on different lines</b>
      <br/>Block up the region with appropriate hilight.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Note that line hilighting may be safely used in a folded buffer.</p>

    </li>

    <li>[000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may toggle
    this from the keyboard using a macro in your <i>user</i>.emf as follows:-

    <ul>
      <pre>

      ; Macro to enable the display of TAB/CR.
      ; Note that we force the screen to be updated.
      define-macro tab-display
          set-variable $system &amp;bxor $system
          0x80000 screen-update
      !emacro
      global-bind-key "tab-display" "f11"</pre>
    </ul></li>

    <li>[000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf).</li>

    <li>[000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta.</li>

    <li>[000112] Revised color hilighting schemes, reduced the number of
    colors in a number of schemes. Introduction of the <b>Sherwood Forest</b>
    color scheme (green theme obviously !!).</li>

    <li>[000112] Small revision to the user interface with respect to font
    selection. In order to make character set selection easier then the
    multiple choices for the box characters have been removed from <b>Menu
    -&gt; Help -&gt; User Setup</b>. These have been replaced with a new check
    box <b>Extended Char Set</b>. This box should be checked to enable the
    special rendering characters and enable the box characters - this is
    typically enabled on X-Windows and MS-Windows.</li>

    <li>[000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name, modification
    time and size. <i>Selecting the directory column title performs a re-sort
    based on the selection, a further selection reverses the order of the
    list</i>.</li>

    <li>[000112] Addition of ftp support (<tt>meu</tt> build on Windows,
    enabled by default on UNIX). Enables files to be edited via ftp, (read and
    write supported). <i>Transfer to another system using
    </i><tt>ftp://[&lt;user&gt;[:&lt;password]@]&gt;&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]/&lt;pathname&gt;</tt>.</li>

    <li>[000112] Improved source code provision for foreign languages, various
    internal problems. Support for Russian (Windows and Cyrillic koi8-r).</li>

    <li>[000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date.</li>

    <li>[000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized wild card
    sequences.
    <ul>

      <p>Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf, britishr.emf, etc.) then the
      following spelling rules may be added to cope with numeric sequences.
      The addition of these rules will spell check hexadecimal sequences and
      validate numeric sequences such as <tt>1st</tt>, <tt>2nd</tt>,
      <tt>3rd</tt> etc. A spelling of <tt>1nd</tt> would generate a spelling
      error. This has not been performed for other languages so submissions
      for other language equivalents would be appreciated.</p>

      <pre>
      ; Add some special word rules to make life easier.
      ; These are for 1st, 2nd 3rd etc.
      add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?1\\(st\\|ST\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?2\\(nd\\|ND\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?3\\(rd\\|RD\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*1[0-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*[04-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
      add-spell-rule "*" "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+"
      ; Spell rules for unit definitions.
      ; These are for 50Mb, 10Kg, -45.56cm 12ft 10.00am 16.00pm etc.
      add-spell-rule "*" "-?\\([0-9]*.\\)?[0-9]+\\(Kg\\|Kb\\|Gb\\|Tb\\|Mb\\|mm\\|cm\\|m\\|Km\\|ft\\|inch\\|mph\\|lb\\|am\\|pm\\)"
      </pre>

    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>[000112] Box selection copy and paste. Bindings are defined as:-

    <p><ul>
      <b>Esc C-w</b> kill-rectangle<br/>
      <b>Esc C-y</b> yank-rectangle
    </ul></p>
    </li>

    <li>[000112] Enhanced info file hilighting (Thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth for
    this).</li>

    <li>[000112] New <b>copy-file</b> command, typically used by the macro
    language for moving files around.</li>

    <li>[000112] Error reporting of bad command line arguments in Microsoft
    Windows environment (Thanks to Pedro Gomes for this).</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>2nd Release - November 1999</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Enhanced the <b>latex</b> support macros following various
    contributions from users.</li>

    <li>Added <i>Favorites</i> to the <i>File</i> pull down menu. This is a
    simple mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites list.</li>

    <li>Ground up implementation of the regular expression pattern matcher,
    following licensing problems with the GNU regex. The resultant pattern
    matcher is now a little faster than GNU regex and is capable of all of the
    standard regular expression pattern matches. The pattern matcher has
    diverged from GNU in that double backslashes are required in the character
    classes <tt>[..]</tt> to allow for escape sequence short cuts such as
    '<tt>\n</tt>' (newline), '<tt>\t</tt>' (tab) etc. It was felt that this
    compromise was better than having to quote the more obscure search
    characters.</li>

    <li>Changed the hilighting and indenting syntax to be GNU regex
    compliant.</li>

    <li>Modified <b>compare-windows</b> to ignore white space by default,
    <b>compare-windows-exact</b> performs an exact character for character
    comparison.</li>

    <li>Enhanced the tags support to handle multiple tags and recursive
    directory tree searching.</li>

    <li>Implemented osd-help, a gui front end to the on-line help. Required
    changes to the help system which gives macros access to the on-line help
    buffer, needed for the index and search.</li>

    <li>Over-hauled the hilighting scheme files and editor to support the
    disabling of buffer hilighting.</li>

    <li>Many bugs fixed on all platforms, in particular unix cutting and
    pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit delay.</li>

    <li>Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.</li>

    <li>Introduced message line variables <b>@mx</b> and <b>@mxa</b>.</li>

    <li>New Games - Crossword cracker. The ideal way to cheat at crosswords.
    Uses the spelling dictionary to guess at the word, given a number of known
    letters.</li>

    <li>Hook file protection against globally bound keys - prevents re-binding
    of user defined keys within the macro.</li>

    <li>Search/Replace fix for exact mode. Environment variable search path
    fix.</li>

    <li>hkm4.emf added back into the release (seemed to have gone
    missing).</li>

    <li>Cut and paste fix when running the UNIX version through an X-Server
    such as Exceed in the Windows environment.</li>

    <li>Plain text printer device added.</li>

    <li>Obscure OSD fix.</li>

    <li>New OSD help search facility Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;General Help.</li>

    <li>Fix for NT hang-up on shut down (typically encountered when running a
    source debugger).</li>

    <li>Fix for NT process spawning with spaces in the names.</li>

    <li>Metris macro fix, OSD bug fix, NT display fix.</li>

    <li>New - color scheme, GVim look.</li>

    <li>New - Unix/Linux support for Wheel Mouse (mouse.emf).</li>

    <li>New - Color schemes, Plain; for those that do not care for an
    abundance of colors.</li>

    <li>Modified the numeric key-pad behaviour to be consistent on all
    platforms. Problems were noted with the UNIX number lock orientation which
    was reversed.</li>

    <li>New - Color sheme variables which allow the hkXXX files to determine
    the level of hilighting to apply to their templates.</li>

    <li>Line length fix; more graceful behaviour (i.e. does not crash) when
    the line length exceeds 64K.</li>

    <li>Intercept the windows 105 keyboard application key (typically right
    hand side of keyboard next to the control key). The key is called "menu".
    By default this is bound in win32.emf, however users may bind it as a
    prefix for their own key combinations in much the same way as
    <code>Alt</code> or <code>C-x</code> if required.</li>

    <li>New; OMG's IDL language template added.</li>

    <li>Fix for windows short name in <code>next-buffer</code>.</li>
