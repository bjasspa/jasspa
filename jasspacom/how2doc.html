<B><U>1.0 Overview of the Documentation Modes</U></B>

    This is the 2nd revision of this  document  that outlines the
    documentation  mode  supported by JASSPA's  MicroEmacs.  This
    document   has  been  revised  from  the  previous   document
    following  a  number  changes  in the  way  that  other  code
    fragments  may be included  into the document and  hilighted.
    These  changes are  effective  from releases made after March
    2000.

    Primarily the original <B><I>&quot;sectioned&quot;</I></B> and <B><I>&quot;pseudo-code&quot;</I></B> document
    types have been  replaced by the <B><I>&quot;-!-  document  -!-&quot;</I></B> type. A
    new  document  type  called <B><I>&quot;-!- text -!-&quot;</I></B> has been  created,
    this is the default for all files with  extension  <B><I>&quot;.txt&quot;</I></B> and
    has no hilighting.

    <B><I>&quot;psuedo-code&quot;</I></B> is now performed by surrounding the pseudo code
    block with document markers:-

&gt;pseudo&gt;
    <I>// Function to do something</I>
    <B>FUNCTION</B> myFunction
    <B>BEGIN</B>
        <B>IF</B> condition
        <B>THEN</B>
            do something
        <B>ENDIF</B>
    <B>END</B>
&gt;doc&gt;

    This technique of inclusion allows other scheme inserts to be
    included   into  the  document   i.e.  <B><I>'C'</I></B>,  BNF  etc.  These
    techniques are discussed later.

    <B><U>1.1 Background</U></B>

    The document mode (enabled on files with extensions of <B><I>&quot;.doc&quot;</I></B>
    or  <B><I>&quot;.txt&quot;</I></B>),  is a  manual  text  layout  mode  that  retains
    formatting.  What  that  basically  means  is that  you do an
    initial  layout  and  there  after the  editor  endeavors  to
    preserve it when you make changes.

    When  you  run  in  document  mode  we  typically  run  in  a
    $fill-mode  <B><I>&quot;B&quot;</I></B>. This is the automatic mode (Both  Automatic)
    that  attempts  to  identify  the format of the text, this is
    based on the word(s)  position on the line and adjacent text.
    As this mode is automatic  mistakes are sometimes  made (i.e.
    it drops to center rather than justified).

    The  advantage  of  running  like  this is once  the  text is
    reasonably   formatted  you  can  then  re-format  the  whole
    document as you make changes (i.e. add and delete things).

    There is a quick  pop-up  help  page  that  shows you the key
    bindings. (I was  planning on putting  these on the mouse but
    never got round to it). Get the help using:-

                          M-h or Esc-h

    <B><U>1.2 Cursor Position</U></B>

    The  cursor  position  is  always  left,  this  is  a  little
    unfamiliar  when  you are  used to  center  or  right  cursor
    positions. This is what happens next

    The general rule is you enter a paragraph and then format the
    paragraph  to the  appropriate  position.  Generally  we edit
    justified  left or  justified  both, it is rare  that we edit
    center or right. Hence left or both is always on.

    <B><U>1.3 Quick Summary</U></B>

<B>     @  C-c C-b Justify about both margins</B>
<B>        C-C C-c Justify center</B>
<B>        C-C C-l Justify left</B>
<B>        C-c C-r Justify right</B>

<B>     @  M-o to fill the paragraph</B>

        If you fill in the middle of a paragraph the cursor stays
        where  it is. If you  fill on a blank  line it fills  the
        next paragraph and advances to the next.

    There  are other  keys to change  the  justification  mode as
    indicated  on the help pop-up.  Paragraph  formatting  may be
    performed from the menu.

    <B><U>1.4 Types of document modes</U></B>

    MicroEmacs  is  currently  shipped with two types of document
    mode:-

    <B><U>1.4.1 Text</U></B>

        Standard  plain  text or no  fixed  format.  No,  colored
        syntax  hilighting  is  applied to the text. A plain text
        file is assumed for files  ending in <B><I>&quot;.txt&quot;</I></B> or those that
        include the magic string <B><I>&quot;-!- text -!-&quot;</I></B>.

    <B><U>1.4.2 Document</U></B>

        Document mode is a more  sophisticated  text mode. Within
        documentation  mode  hilighting  is  applied  to the text
        which  is  assumed  to fit a  loose  set of  rules  which
        designate  the text as a  document.  This may be  section
        numbers, literal paragraphs, bullets etc.

        The  text  must fit  these  loose  constraints  otherwise
        anomalies   occur   with   the   hilighting   which   may
        misrepresent the information.

        A document  file is a file that ends in <B><I>&quot;.doc&quot;</I></B> or include
        the magic string <B><I>&quot;-!- document -!-&quot;</I></B>.

<B><U>2.0 Working In The Text Modes</U></B>

    This  section   describes   the  basics  of  working  in  the
    documentation mode.

    <B><U>2.1 Whats a paragraph ??</U></B>

        A paragraph in  MicroEmacs  is anything that is separated
        by a blank line. There are no control  characters  in the
        text so this really is WYSIWYG !!

        This is the next  paragraph.  So in any of the  automatic
        modes (i.e. <B><I>&quot;N&quot;</I></B>), the context of the surrounding  text is
        used  to  determine  the  paragraph  formatting.  This is
        crude, but operates correctly 95% of the time.
        
        The layout of any existing  text allows the  formatter to
        work out where things should go.

        <B><U>2.1.1 The Fill Column</U></B>

        There is a fill column on the right which  determines how
        long the paragraph is. I'm using a short one so this does
        not get wrapped by the mailer, the typical value is 78.

            $fill-col ..................... <B><I>&quot;65&quot;</I></B>

        Documents  may use  predefined  fill  columns by adding a
        magic  header  to the top of the  file.  i.e. for a plain
        text document:-

            -!- text; fill-column: 65 -!-

        For a document (i.e. with headings and hilighting),  then
        the following header is used:-

            -!- document; fill-column: 65 -!-

        Note  that  the  $fill-column  within  the  documentation
        buffers  is private to that  buffer.  Modifying  the fill
        column affects the current buffer only.

        <B><U>2.2.2 The Fill Mode</U></B>

        The fill mode determines how paragraphs are filled. These
        are   detailed   in  the  on-line   documentation   under
        $fill-mode. The most commonly used settings are:-

            Justify left and right (both or full  justification).
            This  gives neat line  endings on both the  left-hand
            and right-hand sides of the text.

                $fill-mode .................... <B><I>&quot;B&quot;</I></B>

            Justify  left,  produces  a neat  left-hand  edge and
            ragged right-hand edge.

                $fill-mode .................... <B><I>&quot;L&quot;</I></B>

            Justify none, Turns off all justification,  lines are
            not wrapped, what you type is what you get.

                $fill-mode .................... <B><I>&quot;n&quot;</I></B>

        Documents may use predefined  fill mode by adding a magic
        header  to the top of the  file.  i.e.  for a plain  text
        document:-

            -!- text; fill-mode: left -!-

        For a document (i.e. with headings and hilighting),  then
        the following header is used:-

            -!- document; fill-mode: left -!-

        The recognized keywords are:-

<B>        @   full   - Justified left and right margins.</B>
<B>            both   - Justified left and right margins.</B>
<B>            left   - Justified left only</B>
<B>            right  - Justified right only</B>
<B>            center - Justified center text</B>
<B>            none   - Disable all justification</B>

        All modes, with the  exception of none, are assumed to be
        automatic  in  that  they  recognize  pre-formatted  left
        (column 0), right and centered text.

        Where both the fill  column and fill mode  required  then
        they may be specified as:-

            -!- document; fill-column: 65; fill-mode: full -!-

        Note that the $fill-mode within the documentation buffers
        is  private  to that  buffer.  Modifying  the  fill  mode
        affects the current buffer only.

    <B><U>2.2 Left Text (Work off the margin or column 0)</U></B>

        The margin is magic,  anything  on column 0 is assumed to
        be hard left justified text i.e.

This should not
format because it is
hard left

        Most text in the  document  should be off the  margin (or
        gutter).  Text on the  gutter  should  be  restricted  to
        titles for it to work correctly. Gutter text only remains
        untouched in the $fill-mode automatic modes (L/R/C/B).

        Text  may be  moved  to the  gutter  using  <B><I>&quot;C-c  C-g&quot;</I></B> to
        reformat the paragraph.

        <B><U>2.2.1 On a re-format</U></B>

            Left  justified  text is  assumed  to exist at column
            zero  and  does  not  extend  beyond  50% of the fill
            column.

    <B><U>2.3 Right Text (Work to right margin or $fill-col)</U></B>

        Right text is not as you  normally  expected  because the
        cursor is on the left. Enter the text on the left  margin
        and then format it to the right i.e.

My Address
My Street
My County
My Country
My Zip code

        Perform a right paragraph operation on the text i.e. <B><I>&quot;C-c</I></B>
<B><I>        C-r&quot;</I></B>  and  it  appears  on  the  right  at the  $fill-col
        position i.e.

                                                       My Address
                                                        My Street
                                                        My County
                                                       My Country
                                                      My Zip code

        <B><U>2.3.1 On a re-format</U></B>

            With right  text, when you format it lines  extending
            from 50% of the  fill  column  to the end of the line
            are considered to be right justified.

    <B><U>2.4 Center Text</U></B>

        Center  is   similar   to  the  above,  but  a  bit  more
        manageable,  again enter in on the left and then use <B><I>&quot;C-c</I></B>
<B><I>        C-c&quot;</I></B> to center justify. Lines are preserved.

                      This is in the center
                       This is a bit more

        <B><U>2.3.1 On a re-format</U></B>

            If the number of spaces either side of the margins is
            the same (+/-1) then the text is assumed to be center
            justified.  This sometimes  causes  problems when you
            require  justified lines and centering is assumed; in
            this  instance  simply delete the end of the line and
            re-format.

    <B><U>2.5 Justified Text</U></B>

        Any  other  text  that  does  not fit the  aforementioned
        criteria  is  assumed  to be  justified  to  the  current
        setting of $fill-col.

            Indentation  commences  from the first column where a
            text character appears so this line will wrap in line
            with the first.

                Indent again and the same thing happens, this bit
                of text (when I write enough) will keep in line.

    <B><U>2.6 Literal Text</U></B>

        Often  you want to put text in the  document  that is not
        subject  to  justification.  This  is  controlled  by the
        <B><I>&quot;$fill-ignore&quot;</I></B>  variable (use <B><I>&quot;M-x list-variables&quot;</I></B> to see
        them all).

        The default is:-

              $fill-ignore .................. <B><I>&quot;&gt;_@&quot;</I></B>

        Any paragraph that commences with the above characters is
        not filled so:-

        <I>&gt; This is a paragraph</I>
        <I>&gt; that is not subject to re-formatting</I>
        <I>&gt;      spaces</I>
        <I>&gt;          are</I>
        <I>&gt;            retained.</I>

<B>        @ This is another</B>
<B>             note that only the first character</B>
<B>       of the</B>
<B>             paragraph</B>
<B>                is marked</B>
<B>        when you re-format</B>
<B>                             this should be still as you left it.</B>

       <I>_ And</I>
           another - I think this is enough !!

    <B><U>2.7 Bullets</U></B>

        Bullets  are  useful  for  lists  and  alike. As with the
        absolute  text  there are a few of  characters  which are
        recognized as bullet characters. These are defined with:-

<B>        @    $fill-bullet .................. &quot;*)].-&quot;</B>
<B>             $fill-bullet-len .............. &quot;15&quot;</B>

        The   <B><I>&quot;$fill-bullet&quot;</I></B>   characters   are   obviously   the
        characters  recognized as bullets.  <B><I>&quot;$fill-bullet-len&quot;</I></B> is
        the number of  characters  into the paragraph to look for
        bullets. Examples include:-

        <B>*</B> Simple bullet

        <B>*</B> Note that there is a paragraph space between them, also
          note that  bullets  should be  aligned  to the left and
          right. You get prompted to do this when you  re-format.
          If you re-format again you will not be prompted because
          it works  out that the  first 2 lines of the  paragraph
          text are in alignment.

        <B>a)</B> Can have  letters,  the <B><I>&quot;)&quot;</I></B> is the  bullet  character,
           again we should be aligned.

        12345] Can have digits, the <B><I>&quot;]&quot;</I></B> is the bullet  character,
               again we should be aligned.

        Note - This time the  bullet  character  is <B><I>'-'</I></B>, again we
               wrap and square up after the bullet.

               This one sometime  gives me problems when I forget
               it's a bullet so I tend to use a 'soft'  character
               when I do not want the indent i.e.

               Note:  This is what I call a soft  bullet, ME does
               not recognize this one so it wraps OK.

        ix. Maybe a few  Roman  numerals,  it's nice to see these
            from time to time. The bullet here is <B><I>'.'</I></B>.

    <B><U>2.8 Editing the Document</U></B>

        So now you have a text  document and you start to edit it
        and make  changes or run the speller over it. The columns
        go out of alignment.

        If you have  obeyed  all of the above  then you should be
        able to fill all of the  paragraphs  and get them looking
        nice again. you can do this by:-

              Menu -&gt; Format -&gt; Fill all Paragraphs

        Or if you do not  like  the  menu  goto  the top line and
        perform a

                    Esc 10000 M-x fill-paragraph

        then all paragraphs are reformatted.

        <B><U>2.8.1 What is IQ Fill paragraph ??</U></B>

        IQ  Fill   paragraph  as  shown  in  the  menus,  or  the
        <B><I>&quot;ifill-paragraph&quot;</I></B>  command is a macro  alternative to the
        built in  <B><I>&quot;fill-paragraph&quot;</I></B>.  This deals with bullets that
        are  adjacent  (i.e. no  intervening  blank  lines). This
        makes for better presentation but you have to be a little
        careful  that  you  always  use   <B><I>&quot;ifill-paragraph&quot;</I></B>   for
        formatting. i.e.

<B>                 @  * ifill-paragraph  can cope with bullets that</B>

<B>                      are tightly packed.</B>

        This    document    has   not   been    authored    using
        <B><I>&quot;ifill-paragraph&quot;</I></B> and is escaped the above.

    <B><U>2.9 Whats the advantage of the above</U></B>

        The advantage of doing  everything  above is primarily to
        get a reasonable  looking document for the minimum amount
        of work on behalf of the author.

        Maybe I'm not familiar enough with Word Processors, but I
        can do a document  in double time like this  because I do
        not get distracted  with my styles blowing up, fontifying
        things  and  everything  else  going  wrong.  You tend to
        concentrate  on the text and not all the pretty bits that
        are not really  important until you have actually created
        the appropriate words for your masterpiece.

<B><U>3.0 Going Back To The Word Processor</U></B>

    With a finished masterpiece of literature, in plain text then
    it is often desirable to move the text into the  presentation
    engine i.e. the Word Processor.

    Word  processors  tend to put paragraphs on one line. Cutting
    and pasting the  document as it stands does not make for good
    WP text unless the paste  target is a fixed font  destination
    (i.e.  Netscape for mail - not sure about  Microsoft  Outlook
    that probably wants pretty fonts everywhere !!)

    So to prepare, the following operations should be performed.

    <B>a)</B> Reformat your document for single line paragraphs. Do this
       like:-

            Menu -&gt; Format -&gt; All Paragraphs to Lines

       or on the command line.

<B>       @    top of buffer</B>
<B>            Esc 100000 M-x paragraph-to-line</B>

       The paragraph-to-line  operation reduces the paragraphs to
       a single line,  removing any leading  spaces.  These lines
       may be  copied  into  the  word  processor,  resulting  in
       paragraphs.

    <B>b)</B> Format away ....

       You  now  have a bit of work to do  re-formatting  you new
       document  text in your word  processor.  This can be a bit
       tedious but it's simply adding emboldening and italicizing
       here and there  with a few tables and  pictures  thrown in
       for good  measure. You know the text is good so this makes
       for a relaxing brain dead afternoon !!

<B><U>4.0 Extensions</U></B>

    There  are a  number  of  extensions  on the  standard  theme
    outlined above.

    <B><U>4.1 Documents</U></B>

        The document  mode <B><I>&quot;-!- document -!-&quot;</I></B> are text files with
        hilighting   applied.  These   documents  are  tagged  as
        follows:-

        <I>&gt; -!- document -!-</I>
        <I>&gt; Author:   Jon Green</I>
        <I>&gt; Created:  Wed Feb 2 20:23:35 2000</I>
        <I>&gt; Modified: &lt;20000202.2100&gt;</I>

        <B><U>4.1.1 Hilighting Token Summary</U></B>

        The hilighting is kept to a reasonable minimum, including
        the following:-

        Start/End markers

            <I>_</I>
            <B><I>&quot;`..'&quot;</I></B>  <B>`single acute/grave pair'</B>
            <B><I>&quot;*..*&quot;</I></B>  <B>*AnyAlphabeticSurroundedByAsterisks*</B>
            <B><I>&quot;&lt;..&gt;&quot;</I></B>  <I>&lt;AnyAlphabeticSurroundedByGreaterOrLessThan&gt;</I>
            <B><I>&quot;_.._&quot;</I></B>  <U>_AnyAlphabeticSurroundedByUnderScore_</U>

        Literal Text Regions

            <I>&gt; This is a literal text region</I>
            <I>&gt; Hilighting to end of line only.</I>

<B>            @ This is a literal</B>
<B>              region. It hilights</B>
<B>              to the next blank line.</B>

            <I>_ First Line. This is also</I>
              a literal region, no hilighting
              on this one after the first line.

        Strings and quoted characters

            <B><I>&quot;string&quot;</I></B> and quoted <B><I>'q'</I></B> <B><I>'\0'</I></B>

        Headings,  lines  that are  classed  as  <B>`heading'</B>  lines
        commence with the following text sequences:-

            <I>&gt; 4.0 Section Header</I>
            <I>&gt; 4.1.1 Sub-Section header</I>
            <I>&gt; Appendix A</I>
            <I>&gt; Appendix A.1</I>

        Bullets of the * or ) variety

            <B>* </B> Bullet

            <B>1)</B> Bullet

        Note that any bullet-ed  sections with numbers  should be
        defined as:-

            <I>&gt; 1) bullet 1</I>
            <I>&gt; 2) bullet 2</I>

        rather than

            <I>&gt; 1. bullet 1</I>
            <I>&gt; 2. bullet 2</I>

        otherwise the incorrect hilighting will be applied.

    <B><U>4.2 Code Inserts</U></B>

        As  of  the  beginning  of Q2  2000,  then  the  original
        document modes of <B>`sectioned'</B> and <B>`pseudo-code'</B> have been
        removed.  These methods have been replaced by the ability
        to  insert   literal   fragments   of  other   coding  or
        documentation  schemes  into the text and signal a change
        in hilighting.

        Hooks for the code inserts are only supported as standard
        in the <B><I>&quot;-!-  document  -!-&quot;</I></B> mode,  details on  performing
        this type of operation is provided in the next section.

        The new scheme is introduced with a <B><I>&quot;&gt;scheme&gt;&quot;</I></B>  marker on
        the left margin  (gutter),  where <B>`scheme'</B> is the name of
        the scheme that you want to include i.e. the standard set
        includes:-

            <I>_</I>
            <B><I>&quot;&gt;bnf&gt;&quot;</I></B> ............... Backus-Naur Form
            <B><I>&quot;&gt;c&gt;&quot;</I></B> ................. ANSI <B><I>'C'</I></B>
            <B><I>&quot;&gt;cpp&gt;&quot;</I></B>, <B><I>&quot;&gt;c++&gt;&quot;</I></B> ...... C++
            <B><I>&quot;&gt;emf&gt;&quot;</I></B> ............... MicroEmacs macro format
            <B><I>&quot;&gt;pseudo&gt;&quot;</I></B> ............ Pseudo code

        The code statement is terminated with a <B><I>&quot;&gt;doc&gt;&quot;</I></B> statement
        which returns the hilighting  mode to document mode. Note
        that the <B><I>&quot;&gt;&quot;</I></B>  character  has been  selected  as the token
        leader.  Provided that the insert block includes no blank
        lines  then the block is treated as a literal  text block
        and  formatting  the  paragraph  does not affect the code
        block. Here are some examples:-

        <B><U>4.2.1 Pseudo Code Example</U></B>

        Include a pseudo code block:-

&gt;pseudo&gt;
        <I>// A days work</I>
        <B>FUNCTION</B> a days work
        <B>BEGIN</B>
            <I>// A comment for my pseudo code.</I>
            <B>WHILE</B> (<B>NOT</B> bored)
            <B>DO</B>
                <B>IF</B> (this condition is true)
                <B>THEN</B>
                    do something
                <B>ELSE</B>
                    do something else
                <B>ENDIF</B>
            <B>DONE</B>
            <B>RETURN</B> home
        <B>END</B>
&gt;doc&gt;

        The  leading <B><I>'&gt;'</I></B> protects  the text from  formatting.  Be
        careful  not to leave  blank  lines in your  pseudo  code
        because  this is a new  paragraph,  these  are  typically
        plugged with comments.

        <B><U>4.2.2 C Code Example</U></B>

        The classic Hello World program

&gt;c&gt;
        <B>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</B>
        <B>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</B>
        <I>/* Entry point */</I>
        <B>int</B>
        main (<B>int</B> argc, <B>char</B> *argv[])
        {
            printf (<B><I>&quot;Hello World\n&quot;</I></B>);
            <B>return</B> 0;
        }
&gt;doc&gt;

        <B><U>4.2.3 Backus-Naur Form</U></B>

        This  one is  included  as  standard  as it is  typically
        included  in  technical   documentation.  Follows  is  an
        example  of  BNF  for  the  Pascal  programming  language
        decimal notation:-

&gt;bnf&gt;
        <I>!! Pascal decimal notation.</I>
        <B>&lt;digit sequence&gt;</B> <B>::=</B> <B>&lt;digit&gt;</B> <B>{</B> <B>&lt;digit&gt;</B> <B>}</B>
        <B>&lt;unsigned integer&gt;</B> <B>::=</B> <B>&lt;digit sequence&gt;</B>
        <B>&lt;unsigned real&gt;</B> <B>::=</B>
            <B>&lt;unsigned integer&gt;</B>.<B>&lt;digit sequence&gt;</B> <B>|</B>
            <B>&lt;unsigned integer&gt;</B>.<B>&lt;digit sequence&gt;</B>E<B>&lt;scale factor&gt;</B> <B>|</B>
            <B>&lt;unsigned integer&gt;</B> E <B>&lt;scale factor&gt;</B>
        <B>&lt;unsigned number&gt;</B> <B>::=</B>
            <B>&lt;unsigned integer&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>&lt;unsigned real&gt;</B>
        <B>&lt;scale factor&gt;</B> <B>::=</B>
            <B>&lt;unsigned integer&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>&lt;sign&gt;&lt;unsigned integer&gt;</B>
        <B>&lt;sign&gt;</B> <B>::=</B> + <B>|</B> -
&gt;doc&gt;

    <B><U>4.3 Extending the Code Inserts</U></B>

        The number code insert types that may be supported may be
        increased  by defining  other code types within the local
        users extension file <B><I>&quot;mydoc.emf&quot;</I></B>. i.e. to add the HTML to
        the supported set then the following would be defined.

&gt;emf&gt;
    <I>; Allow HTML Code inserts</I>
    <I>; Force the &quot;.html&quot; scheme to be loaded into the context of</I>
    <I>; the document scheme. We delimit the .html scheme with a</I>
    <I>; pair of markers &quot;&gt;html&gt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;doc&gt;&quot;</I>
    <I>;</I>
    <I>; Force the hilighting mode to load if not already loaded.</I>
    <B>!if</B> <B>&amp;seq</B> <B>.hilight.html</B> <B><I>&quot;ERROR&quot;</I></B>
        <B>!force</B> execute-file <B><I>&quot;hkhtml&quot;</I></B>
    <B>!endif</B>
    <I>; If the hilighting mode is loaded then modify it.</I>
    <B>!if</B> <B>&amp;not</B> <B>&amp;seq</B> <B>.hilight.html</B> <B><I>&quot;ERROR&quot;</I></B>
        hilight <B>.hilight.doc</B> 0xc0 <B><I>&quot;^&gt;html&gt;&quot;</I></B> <B><I>&quot;&gt;html&gt;&quot;</I></B> <B>.hilight.html</B> <B>.scheme.hide</B>
        hilight <B>.hilight.html</B> 0xc0 <B><I>&quot;^&gt;doc&gt;&quot;</I></B> <B><I>&quot;&gt;doc&gt;&quot;</I></B> <B>.hilight.doc</B> <B>.scheme.hide</B>
    <B>!endif</B>
&gt;doc&gt;

        The  macro  fragment  is simply  executed  when the first
        document  is  loaded.  There  is no need to  include  any
        additional  code in the hook  commands. The  operation of
        the code is defined as follows:-

&gt;emf&gt;
        <B>!if</B> <B>&amp;seq</B> <B>.hilight.html</B> <B><I>&quot;ERROR&quot;</I></B>
            <B>!force</B> execute-file <B><I>&quot;hkhtml&quot;</I></B>
        <B>!endif</B>
&gt;doc&gt;

        The  first  set of  commands  make  sure that the  target
        hilighting  scheme  is  loaded,  if they  are not then an
        explicit load is forced.

&gt;emf&gt;
        <B>!if</B> <B>&amp;not</B> <B>&amp;seq</B> <B>.hilight.html</B> <B><I>&quot;ERROR&quot;</I></B>
&gt;doc&gt;

        Check that the hilighting  scheme is loaded, if it is not
        then the scheme modifications are not applied.

&gt;emf&gt;
        hilight <B>.hilight.doc</B> 0xc0 <B><I>&quot;^&gt;html&gt;&quot;</I></B> <B><I>&quot;&gt;html&gt;&quot;</I></B> <B>.hilight.html</B> <B>.scheme.hide</B>
&gt;doc&gt;

        Declare a hilighting token in the documentation scheme to
        jump to the HTML hilighting scheme. The token that we use
        is <B><I>&quot;&gt;html&gt;&quot;</I></B>  which must  appear at the start of the line,
        hence is defined  <B><I>&quot;^&gt;html&gt;&quot;</I></B>. The second  <B><I>&quot;&gt;html&gt;&quot;</I></B>  string
        defines  what appears on the screen. This may be modified
        if the screen  appearance is different  from the tag that
        appears  in  the  text.  <B>`.hilight.html'</B>  is  the  scheme
        identifier  of the  target  scheme  to which a branch  is
        being taken. <B>`.scheme.hide'</B> is the color in which the tag
        is rendered, the hidden scheme is selected here to reduce
        the prominence of the tag (it is still visible).

&gt;emf&gt;
        hilight <B>.hilight.html</B> 0xc0 <B><I>&quot;^&gt;doc&gt;&quot;</I></B> <B><I>&quot;&gt;doc&gt;&quot;</I></B> <B>.hilight.doc</B> <B>.scheme.hide</B>
&gt;doc&gt;

        The next  statement  defines  the  hilighting  token that
        returns the hilighting back to the documentation hilight.
        This is the same as the  previous  statement  except that
        the  hilight  token is  placed in the  target  hilighting
        scheme to return the hilight to the  documentation  mode.
        Typically <B><I>&quot;&gt;doc&gt;&quot;</I></B> may be used unless it conflicts with an
        existing hilighting token in the target scheme.

        <B><U>4.3.1 Important Note on Code Inserts</U></B>

            In order for the code  inserts  to operate  correctly
            then the  hilighting  schemes  must enable look back.
            This is defined when the scheme is initialized,  with
            a statement like:-

&gt;emf&gt;
            0 hilight  <B>.hilight.doc</B> 2 50  <B>$global</B>-scheme
&gt;doc&gt;

            Typically a look back value of 50 lines is specified,
            this restricts the insert blocks to 50 lines of text.
            These   values   may  be   extended   if   they   are
            insufficient, by may reduce the rendering speed.

    <B><U>4.4 Folding</U></B>

        The  folding  feature  of ME using  narrowing  allows  an
        overview  of  the  document  to be  created.  Folding  is
        supported  as standard in the <B><I>&quot;-!- document -!-&quot;</I></B> template
        where the folds are performed on the section numbers. The
        function  keys  <B><I>&quot;F2&quot;</I></B> and <B><I>&quot;F3&quot;</I></B>, by  default,  control  the
        folding.  In  addition   &lt;S-Left-Mouse&gt;  folds  a  single
        section.

        The whole  document may be folded with <B><I>&quot;f3&quot;</I></B> the resultant
        output of this document looks exactly like this:

        This  makes  it  easy to  edit.  Note  that a dummy  last
        section is added to make  everything  fold nicely. Single
        sections may be unfolded with <B><I>&quot;f2&quot;</I></B>.

        With  folding  enabled  then  one has to be a little  bit
        careful not to edit over a folded section.

        <B><U>4.4.1 Redefining the Folding</U></B>

        The  definition of the folds may be redefined by the user
        by extending the macro template  through  <B><I>&quot;mydoc.emf&quot;</I></B>. As
        an example of folding about section  numbers (i.e. <B><I>&quot;1.2.3</I></B>
<B><I>        title&quot;</I></B>) then the following extension is sufficient:-

&gt;emf&gt;
<I>; my-fhook-doc; Extend the document bindings</I>
0 <B><U>define-macro my</U></B>-fhook-doc
    <I>; setup doc buffer folding support used in section</I>

        Note that  these  extensions  are not  necessary  for the

        <B><U>4.5 Extending the Hilighting</U></B>

        The  <B><I>&quot;mydoc.emf&quot;</I></B>  may be used to extend  the  hilighting.
        These are  usually  tailored  to the kind of text that is
        worked  with. For  example  ~word~ may be added as a bold
        token,  and  %word%  as  italic.  This  could be added to
        <B><I>&quot;mydoc.emf&quot;</I></B> as follows:-

&gt;emf&gt;
        hilight <B>.hilight.doc</B> 0 <B><I>&quot;~[A-Za-z_]+~&quot;</I></B> <B>.scheme.bold</B>
        hilight <B>.hilight.doc</B> 0 <B><I>&quot;%[A-Za-z_]+%&quot;</I></B> <B>.scheme.italic</B>
&gt;doc&gt;

        <B><U>4.6 Section Renumbering</U></B>

        A number of macro  solutions have been posted to the mail
        reflector  on this  subject. I suggest that you look over
        these.

    <B><U>4.5 Other Tools</U></B>

        Other tools used with the documentation include:-

        <B>*</B> spell-buffer (Command line or menu)

            Spell checker.

        <B>*</B> clean (command line or menu)

            Removes all of the trailing spaces.

        <B>*</B> count-words

            Counts all the words.

        <B>*</B> print-buffer

            From the print dialog, an HTML  rendering of the page
            may  be  printed  to  a  buffer.  This   inserts  the
            appropriate  HTML hilighting into the page, retaining
            the layout.

<B><U>5.0 Did you get this far ??</U></B>

    If you got this far well done !!

    Exercise.

            Cut and paste  this into a document  and have a go !!
            You should be able to reformat the whole document and
            nothing will change.
