<H2><B>NAME </B></H2>
<UL><P>kill-paragraph - Delete a paragraph </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><I>n</I> <B>kill-paragraph</B> </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>kill-paragraph</B> deletes the next <I>n</I> paragraphs from the current cursor position, the paragraphs that are killed are added to the kill buffer. If the cursor is in the middle of a paragraph then the text from the current cursor position to the end (or start, depending on direction) of the paragraph is deleted. 
<P>If <I>n</I> is +ve then the kill direction is forwards, if <I>n</I> is -ve then the kill direction is backwards. If <I>n</I> is <TT>0</TT> (zero) the command simply returns. The default value for <I>n</I> is <TT>+1</TT>. </UL>
<H2><B>DIAGNOSTICS </B></H2>
<UL><P>The following errors can be generated, in each case the command returns a FALSE status: 
<P><B>[end of buffer]</B> 
<BR><UL>The +ve argument <I>n</I> is greater than the number of remaining paragraphs, all of the remaining paragraphs to the end of the buffer are still removed. </UL>
<P><B>[top of buffer]</B> 
<BR><UL>The -ve argument <I>n</I> is greater than the number of previous paragraphs, all of the previous paragraphs to the top of the buffer are still removed. </UL></UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>A paragraph is terminated by a blank line. All text residing between two blank lines is considered to be a paragraph - regardless of the text layout. </UL>
<H2><B>HISTORY </B></H2>
<UL><P>The behavior of <B>kill-paragraph</B> was modified in November 2004 after which the numeric argument <I>n</I> was interpreted to control the number and direction of paragraphs to delete. Previous releases interpreted a -ve value as a control to disable the deleted text from entering the kill buffer. If the existing behavior is required then 
<A HREF="m2cmd081.html">kill-region(2)</A> with a -ve argument should be used to delete a region of marked text, 
<A HREF="m2cmd094.html">forward-paragraph(2)</A> and 
<A HREF="m2cmd094.html">backward-paragraph(2)</A> may be used to move to the appropriate kill position. </UL>
