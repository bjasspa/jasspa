<H2><B>QUESTION (05) </B></H2>
<UL><P>ipipes not working on Microsoft Windows network drives ? </UL>
<H2><B>ANSWER </B></H2>
<UL><P>We are aware of a problem with the ipipe commands with '95 and '98 (not sure about NT) when the current drive is a Novel network drive. 
<P>Although we have not been ably to fully characterize the problem, we know that:- <UL><P>
<LI>Old Novel Clients prior to 2.2 - Does not work 
<LI>Novel Intranetware Client 2.2 - Does not work. 
<LI>Novel Network Client 2.5 - Does work. 
<LI>Novel Client 3.01 - Does work. </UL><P>Any other information in this area would be appreciated to fully characterize the problem. 
<P>To get around the problem then disable ipipes using 
<A HREF="m5var047.html">$system(5)</A>. From within your <I>&lt;user&gt;.emf</I> knock off bit 0x800 from 
<A HREF="m5var047.html">$system(5)</A>. This will enable regular pipes, which will work, albeit not in the background. 
<P>
