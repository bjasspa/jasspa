<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>Triangle</B> </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>Triangle</B> is a solitaire game using a standard set of playing cards. The object of the game is to use all of the cards in the deck to build up four suit stacks from Ace to King. 
<P>The board is laid out so that every card is used to create a triangle shape. In the first column there is one up-turned card, in the second column there is one down-turned card and 2 up-turned, third has 2 down 3 up etc. The only break form this pattern is in the last 3 columns where there is an extra up-turned card so that all the deck is used. 
<P>Cards may be moved around the playing area by stacking the same suit cards in descending order on the row stacks. When a row stack has no up-turned cards on the stack then the top card may be turned over and may be played. If a stack becomes empty then only a King may be moved into the vacant position. 
<P>If the last card in a stack is an Ace then it can be moved to its suit stack, then the 2 of that suit etc. until finally the King is removed. 
<P>Cards are moved around the board using the mouse. Cards may be moved from one row stack to another row stack by placing the mouse over the 'from' stack and pressing the left mouse button. Move the cursor to the 'to' stack and release the left mouse button. If the move is legal then the card(s) are moved to the new stack. Multiple cards may be moved from the row stacks, the appropriate card(s) to be moved is automatically determined. 
<P>Cards may be moved onto the suit stacks by a single left mouse press and release on the same card, the card is moved to the appropriate suit stack. The same technique is used to turn cards over in the suit stacks. 
<P>Note that once a card is played onto the suit stacks then it cannot be removed. 
<P>To the right of the board are a number of control buttons. To select an option, click the left mouse button on it, the buttons are labeled:
