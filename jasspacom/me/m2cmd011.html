<UL><P>start-kbd-macro - Start/stop recording keyboard macro end-kbd-macro - Stop recording keyboard macro </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>start-kbd-macro</B> (<B>C-x&nbsp;(</B>)&nbsp; 
<BR><B>end-kbd-macro</B> (<B>C-x&nbsp;)</B>)&nbsp; </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>A keyboard macro is a short hand way to repeat a series of characters. In effect, a <I>recording</I> is made of the sequence of keys that you hit while defining a keyboard macro. The recording is started with <B>start-kbd-macro</B> and ended with <B>end-kbd-macro</B>. The recording is then repeated whenever you execute the keyboard macro using 
<A HREF="m2cmd046.html">execute-kbd-macro(2)</A>. 
<P>Since it is key-strokes that are being saved, you can freely intermix commands and text to be inserted into the buffer. 
<P>You can save a keyboard macro for later using the 
<A HREF="m2cmd089.html">name-kbd-macro(2)</A> command, which saves the keyboard macro as a named macro. Otherwise if you start another keyboard macro recording session, the previously defined macro is lost. So make sure that you are done with the current keyboard macro before defining another one. If you have a series of commands that you would like to <I>record</I> for later use, 
<A HREF="m2cmd074.html">insert-macro(2)</A> can be used to insert the macro into a text file and can be reloaded using the 
<A HREF="m2cmd045.html">execute-file(2)</A> or 
<A HREF="m2cmd044.html">execute-buffer(2)</A> commands. 
<P>Recording commences with <B>start-kbd-macro</B> (<TT>C-x&nbsp;(</TT>) and terminates when an <B>end-kbd-macro</B> (<TT>C-x&nbsp;)</TT> is encountered. </UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>Once <B>start-kbd-macro</B> has been executed, the mouse is disabled until <B>end-kbd-macro</B> is executed. This is because the mouse events cannot be successfully recorded in macros. The main menu can still be used, but only via the keyboard bindings and hot-keys (note that the layout of the menu may change). </UL>
