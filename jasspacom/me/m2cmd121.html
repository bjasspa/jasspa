<UL><P>set-mark - Set starting point of region </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>set-mark</B> (<B>esc space</B>)&nbsp; </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>set-mark</B> is used to delimit the beginning of a marked region. Many commands are effective for a region of text. A region is defined as the text between the mark and the current cursor position. To delete a section of text, for example, one moves the cursor to the beginning of the text to be deleted, issues the <B>set-mark</B> command by typing <B>esc space</B>, moves the cursor to the end of the text to be deleted, and then deletes it by using the 
<A HREF="m2cmd081.html">kill-region(2)</A> (<B>C-w</B>) command. Only one mark can be set in one window or one buffer at a time, and MicroEmacs '02 will try to remember a mark set in an off screen buffer when it is called back on screen. 
<P>A region is a block of text to be acted upon by some MicroEmacs '02 commands. It is demarcated by the <B>POINT</B> on one end and the <B>MARK</B> at the other. The point is the primary location identifier where most of the action takes place and is always between two characters. The point is indicated by the cursor position in that it is just behind the cursor. The point is also significant in that it defines one end of the region. The mark, on the other hand, is invisible, and is used to demarcate the other end of the region and is set through <B>set-mark</B>. </UL>
