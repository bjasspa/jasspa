<H2><B>NAME </B></H2>
<UL><P>memsdev - Microsoft Developer Studio Add-in for MicroEmacs '06 </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>memsdev.dll</B> </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>meMsdev</B> is a Microsoft Visual Studio Add-In that allows MicroEmacs '06 to be integrated as the default text editor. It will be used instead of the Visual Studio built in editor when you double click on a file or press F4. 
<P><B>meMsdev</B> may not be supplied built and should be built using Microsoft Developer Studio. </UL>
<H2><B>INSTALLATION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>1)</B> Copy mesdev.dll into the MicroEmacs directory i.e. <UL>
<PRE>c:/Program&nbsp;Files/JASSPA/MicroEmacs 
</PRE></UL>
<P><B>2)</B> Edit the 
<A HREF="m8fil006.html">me32.ini(8)</A> file in your Windows directory and identify the location of the MicroEmacs executable. The executable name is used to spawn MicroEmacs if it is not already running. The entry takes the form:- <UL>
<PRE>;&nbsp;Identify&nbsp;the&nbsp;location&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;MicroEmacs&nbsp;executable&nbsp;so&nbsp;that&nbsp;the 
;&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio&nbsp;&quot;Add-In&quot;&nbsp;can&nbsp;locate&nbsp;the&nbsp;executable 
[Location] 
exe=c:\Program&nbsp;Files\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe 
</PRE></UL>
<P>Change the <I>exe</I> entry to match the location and name of your executable. 
<P><B>3)</B> For MS-DEV V5.0 only; from a DOS box, register the DLL using <B>regsvr32.exe(1)</B> i.e. <UL>
<PRE>&gt;&nbsp;cd&nbsp;c:/Program&nbsp;Files/JASSPA/MicroEmacs 
&gt;&nbsp;regsvr32&nbsp;memsdev.dll 
</PRE></UL>
<P>For MS-DEV V6.0 it is not necessary to perform this registration step. 
<P><B>4)</B> Start Visual Studio and goto:- <UL>
<PRE>Tools 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customize... 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add-Ins&nbsp;and&nbsp;Macro&nbsp;Files 
</PRE></UL>
<P><B>5)</B> Click on <I>Browse</I> and point Visual Studio to your <B>memsdev.dll</B> file. 
<P><B>6)</B> Click the check box to indicate that you want to use the Add-In, and close the Customize dialog box. 
<P><B>7)</B> You should notice the MicroEmacs tool bar showing the MicroEmacs Icon. This invokes a dialog that allows you to attach and detach MicroEmacs as the default editor. </UL>
<H2><B>USING meMsdev </B></H2>
<UL><P>Clicking on the MicroEmacs Tool bar shows the meMsdev configuration dialog. Check the boxes when MicroEmacs edit session is required as default; uncheck the boxes if you wish to revert to the built-in dialog. 
<P>Use Visual Studio as normal, and MicroEmacs should almost always bring MicroEmacs to the foreground to edit the document. If a MicroEmacs is already running then &quot;meMsdev&quot; will attach to an existing session and will load the file. If MicroEmacs is not detected then a new version is spawned off and then an attachment is made. </UL>
<H2><B>RUNNING A DEBUG SESSION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>meMsdev</B> does not currently provide any debugging capability (but we are working on it !!). To start debugging it is suggested that the Editor is decoupled <I>(MicroEmacs Dialogue -&gt; Uncheck Boxes)</I> and work within the Developer studio. 
<P>When you have finished debugging and wish to move back to an edit session then re-enable MicroEmacs <I>(MicroEmacs Dialogue -&gt; Check Boxes)</I> AND close any windows that are open within the MS-Dev environment ( <I>Window-&gt;Windows...-&gt;Select All</I> and <I>Close All Windows</I>). Then commence editing again. 
<P>While MicroEmacs is attached, selecting any of the find file lines, compilation error lines etc within the response panes will take MicroEmacs to the specified line. </UL>
<H2><B>BUGS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>meMsdev</B> works by hooks exposed by Visual Studio. Most of the functionality works from the OpenDocument (look it up in VS 5) hook. So...If a document is ALREADY open in Visual Studio, and you double click the file in the File Browser...Emacs will NOT come to the foreground. Since the document was open in the Visual Studio editor, the OpenDocument event never occurred. </UL>
