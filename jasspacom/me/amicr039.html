<H2><B>ORIGINS </B></H2>
<UL><P>This version of MicroEmacs is based on an early <I>MicroEmacs</I> release of 3.8 in 1988, the origins of which are unknown, except to say it was delivered on a unmarked 5 1/2&quot; floppy disk. 
<P>The program was originally ported to a Motorola MVME147 UNIX box as an alternative to <B>vi</B>. Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as it constantly crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the development of MicroEmacs '04 commenced. 
<P>Development has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole oblivious to further developments of the existing <B>MicroEmacs</B> program. This was due to no Internet access. It was not until 1996 the next version of <B>MicroEmacs</B> and <B>mewin</B> (Microsoft Windows (TM) port of the same program) was downloaded from the Internet and compared. By this time MicroEmacs '04 was radically different and we were not about to mesh the two together - that would be a step backwards. 
<P>Development of MicroEmacs '04 has been biased towards the UNIX platform, as most of the early development was performed in the UNIX domain. The first of the window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the implementation of the Microsoft Windows port. Latterly, we have seen the resurgence of the IBM-PC platform which is now commonplace. For the return port to the DOS environment, and subsequent development of the Microsoft Windows port, a UNIX like interface was required. Most existing users could not abide the primitive editors found on these machines; Microsoft Windows was an alien and hostile environment when compared with UNIX. Hence, the MicroEmacs '04 interface utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across all platforms. 
<P>For portability, MicroEmacs '04 utilizes character rendering on all platforms regardless of the window manager. Under X-Windows and Microsoft Windows, the display is still treated as a character based display, the subtle difference is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that the scroll bars, fonts etc. are not as slick as they could be, certainly under Microsoft Windows MicroEmacs '04 looks positively primitive!! Regardless of the look, the goal of a common editor across all working platforms has been achieved! </UL>
<H2>Development History </H2>
<UL><P><B>7th Release - March 2004</B> <UL><P>
<LI>[040326] Release wrapped - public release tag is <B>20040301</B> for executable and macros. 
<LI>[040326] Support for MAC O/S Darwin image. Console only (no build machine available for X-11 version). 
<LI>[040326] Introduction of UPX on Windows and DOS executables for <B>ne</B> only. 
<LI>[040326] Support for MS-DOS long name under DJGPP v2.0. For version 2.0 then the DJGPP functions must be invoked rather than the MS-DOS BIOS calls otherwise the modified short name is returned. DJGPP v1 is still supported original definitions maintained. 
<LI>[040326] Added 
<A HREF="m3fcl012.html">filetype(3f)</A> macro to determine the file type of MS-DOS, Windows or UNIX. 
<LI>[040322] <I>$mouse</I> variables configured under console modes to allow pseudo mouse operations to be performed. 
<LI>[040322] Fixed the <B>win32s</B> build and emain.h definitions. Mouse was not supported under <I>win32s</I> through incorrect configuration definition. 
<LI>[040322] Key bindings for the file browser. <TT>ENTER</TT> now handled on the reserved fields to sort. <TT>BACKSPACE</TT> now moves up a directory level. 
<LI>[040322] Changed the interface to <B>cvs</B>, <B>ftp</B> and <B>file-browser</B> command so that if a numeric argument of <TT>0</TT> is given then the directory tree window is not opened, just the <TT>*files*</TT> buffer. 
<LI>[040322] AutoIt hook. Thanks to Dr Detlef Groth. 
<LI>[040322] Added CSS template. Thanks to Gabriel Tabares-Barreiro. 
<LI>[040318] Fix to Microsoft Windows clipboard when operating with VNC. 
<LI>[040317] Macro and source release set to &quot;<TT>20040301</TT>&quot;. 
<LI>[040317] Added 
<A HREF="m3mac075.html">find(3)</A> command to macro set. 
<LI>[040317] Corrected 
<A HREF="m3mac001.html">rgrep(3)</A> to use the 
<A HREF="m3mac075.html">%find-com(5)</A> to specify the <B>find(1)</B> command. 
<LI>[040310] Fix to graphical diff - 
<A HREF="m3mac044.html">gdiff(3)</A>. Occasions where all changes had been accepted and the changes could not be saved. gdiff incorrectly prompted user to accept all changes first. 
<LI>[040310] Support for multiple comment styles in the same language template. Additional comment styles are defined in the &quot;<TT>hkXXX.emf</TT>&quot; file with the syntax &quot;<TT>.fhook-XXX.comment-N</TT>&quot; where &quot;<TT>N</TT>&quot; is an integer starting for <I>1</I> to <I>n</I>, the number of different comment styles. Templates updated to use multiple comment styles where appropriate (C, C++ and SQL). 
<LI>[040310] Support the '<I>r</I>' flag in &quot;<TT>.fhook-XXX.comment</TT>&quot; flag field. Causes the key binding to &quot;<TT>esc-o</TT>&quot; and &quot;<TT>esc-q</TT>&quot; to restyle the comment. All templates updated to include the flag where appropriate. 
<LI>[040310] 
<A HREF="m3mac057.html">cvs(3)</A> operates asynchronously using ipipes. Refresh problems resolved. 
<LI>[040310] 
<A HREF="m3mac074.html">narrow-search-forward(3)</A> bound to &quot;<TT>C-c s</TT>&quot;, 
<A HREF="m3mac074.html">narrow-search-backward(3)</A> bound to &quot;<TT>C-c r</TT>&quot;. 
<LI>[040308] 
<A HREF="m2cmd077.html">ipipe-shell-command(2)</A> includes additional flag to run in &quot;<I>raw mode</I>&quot; where the buffer is not annotated and wrap is disabled. Additional argument added to command to allow the 
<A HREF="m5var006.html">$buffer-ipipe(5)</A> macro to be defined when the pipe is defined. Corrected operation of 
<A HREF="m2cmd098.html">pipe-shell-command(2)</A> where <I>ipipe</I> automatically degrades to a <I>pipe</I> (Windows only), if degraded then the 
<A HREF="m5var006.html">$buffer-ipipe(5)</A> macro is still invoked on completion. 
<LI>[040226] Deleted &quot;<TT>cygnus.emf</TT>&quot; added &quot;<TT>cygwin.emf</TT>&quot; for 
<A HREF="m3mac033.html">cygwin(3)</A> BASH shell support under Windows. Corrected the shell operation with macro layer for echo and completion. 
<LI>[040224] Add new <I>narrow out unhilighted lines</I> feature. 
<LI>[040223] Add new buffer tab list toolbar tool for rapid access to buffers via a top or bottom toolbar. 
<LI>[040223] Add <TT>&lt;&gt;</TT> buttons to toolbar mode lines to scroll left and right. 
<LI>[040223] Fixed. Calender day is off by one when going backwards to before 2004. 
<LI>[040223] Fixed. Executing 'me' (<B>user-setup</B> <B>-&gt;</B> <B>Current</B>) breaks 
<A HREF="m3mac039.html">auto-spell(3)</A> until a main spell command , 
<A HREF="m3osd002.html">spell-word(3)</A> or 
<A HREF="m3osd002.html">spell-buffer(3)</A> is executed. 
<LI>[040223] 
<A HREF="m3mac057.html">cvs(3)</A> directory listing file loss solved. Differences between CVS command line operations and directory list operations resolved, both now produce the same results. 
<LI>[040229] Fixed UNIX signal lock synchronization, solves problems with read failing following FTP or HTTP command. 
<LI>[040223] Add new 
<A HREF="m3mac074.html">narrow-search-forward(3)</A> and 
<A HREF="m3mac074.html">narrow-search-backward(3)</A> commands. 
<LI>[040220] Mouse wheel operation fixed. Added new <B>mouse-wup-scroll</B> commands that should be used instead. 
<LI>[040218] Added '<I>Invert Selection</I>' to context menu. 
<LI>[040218] Add '<TT>f5</TT>' refresh binding to a dir list buffer. 
<LI>[040218] Fixed. Need some way of opening the right mouse button menu using a key. Also need so termcap bindings to open main and context menus. Created new context-menu command, bound to <TT>S-f1</TT> and the windows 'menu' key (aka windows) and created binds to open main menu (<B>esc&nbsp;=</B>) and context menu (<B>esc&nbsp;+</B>) on termcap platforms. 
<LI>[040217] Fixed. <B>2</B> 
<A HREF="m2cmd100.html">popup-window(2)</A> does not work on an XTerm, no implementation in function <TT>meFrameXTermMakeCur</TT>. 
<LI>[040217] Fixed. CVS status of directories is not shown. Also add '<TT>b</TT>' and '<TT>o</TT>' file type flags. 
<LI>[040216] Fixed. ME <B>build.bat -l</B> options do not work in standard cmd/command as there use 4DOS '<TT>&gt;&gt;&amp;</TT>' extension. Changed to using <TT>2&gt;&amp;1</TT> which works on cmd &amp; 4nt but breaks 4Dos and command. 
<LI>[040216] Fixed bottom Toolbar window grows when CVS is opened, 
<A HREF="m2cmd063.html">change-window-depth(2)</A> does not respect bit 2 of 
<A HREF="m5var084.html">$window-flags(5)</A>. 
<LI>[040214] Added <B>.spec</B> template for RedHat RPM package file specification. 
<LI>[040214] Added <B>.psf</B> template for HP-UX depot product file specification. 
<LI>[040214] Recognize <TT>-*-&nbsp;makefile&nbsp;-*-</TT> and <TT>-*-&nbsp;sh&nbsp;-*-</TT>. 
<LI>[040213] Fixed reframe <I>cvs-console</I> better so the exit status can be easily seen from a small window. 
<LI>[040213] PHP script can be started with '<TT>&lt;?</TT>' tag in a php file. 
<LI>[040213] Corrected UNIX ishell operation when &quot;<B>su</B>&quot; to another user. Locking up or generally behaving badly (termio not initialized). Affects all UNIX platforms. 
<LI>[040213] Documented the create/delete/next-frame keys. 
<LI>[040210] Fixed toolbar Directory File List does not contain &quot;<TT>../</TT>&quot; - UNIX only. 
<LI>[040210] Fixed. On UNIX only the 
<A HREF="m5var066.html">$progname(5)</A> may not be fully expanded (has just &quot;me&quot;) which may lead to a ctags generation error and an alternate fix to 
<A HREF="m5var057.html">$search-path(5)</A>. 
<LI>[040210] Fixed. On UNIX, 
<A HREF="m2cmd056.html">find-file(2)</A> of a symbolic link which points to a directory results in a bad dir listing. The list of files is correct but the stats are all wrong (found on sunos 5.8). 
<LI>[040210] Fix subtle ftp bug with alias ftp addressed. Create an ftp site &quot;<TT>ftp://test/</TT>&quot; say with user name foo and passwd bar and then load in &quot;<TT>ftp://test/dir1/</TT>&quot; the buffer file name is correctly set as &quot;<TT>ftp://test/dir1/</TT>&quot; but the 'Directory listing of:' line is set to &quot;<TT>ftp://foo@test/dir1/</TT>&quot;. Firstly the user may wish the '<I>foo</I>' to be hidden but secondly with the introduction of being able to click on the '<I>Directory</I> <I>listing of:</I>' line this has introduced a subtle inefficiency/bug, if I click on the '<TT>foo@test</TT>' ME will load &quot;<TT>ftp://foo@test/</TT>&quot; not &quot;<TT>ftp://test/</TT>&quot; which to ME is a completely different file. This can in turn lead to &quot;<TT>ftp://foo@test/dir1/</TT>&quot; being loaded so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being loaded! The fix is to make the '<I>Directory listing of:</I>' line the same, i.e. &quot;<TT>ftp://test/dir1/</TT>&quot; 
<LI>[040208] Fixed. &quot;<B>-n</B>&quot; command line option to a console build causes a option failure and the executable does not run. 
<LI>[040208] Corrected UNIX jasspa tree search when executable is in CWD and there is no executable path. 
<LI>[040206] <B>RC4 - Release Candidate 4 - MicroEmacs '04</B> 
<LI>[040206] Fixes for tool-bar Buffer Item List update problem. Thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth. 
<LI>[040206] Added template support for XML. Thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth. 
<LI>[040204] Re-worked Microsoft Windows 
<A HREF="m8fil006.html">me32.ini(8)</A> file specification. Order revised and lookup simplified. 
<LI>[040203] &quot;<I>user-setup</I>&quot; changed name to &quot;<I>Rebind Home Keys</I>&quot; for re-binding of <TT>home</TT> and <TT>end</TT> keys to start/end of line. Removed &quot;<TT>C-v</TT>&quot; binding that existed with old &quot;<I>MS keys&quot; label</I>. 
<LI>[040203] Reworked all user defined defined directory save locations, ftp, spell, etc.. 
<LI>[040203] Corrected osf1, openBSD and zaraus emf files. 
<LI>[040203] Added 
<A HREF="m3mac057.html">%cvs-com(5)</A> variable to define the CVS command. 
<LI>[040203] XML template extended to include javascript. 
<LI>[040130] 2nd iteration of prototype and near final revision of new user setup. 
<UL><P>Following an internal review of RC3 then it has been decided to address the issues of user configuration prior to a full release. This specifically addresses the location of user MicroEmacs configuration directories and search paths. User configuration has traditionally required the setting of external environment variables such as &quot;$MEPATH&quot; and for the user to create a private directory to store user settings. This is proving difficult for new users who just want to run the editor. RC4 and subsequent releases will address these problems by determining the correct location for configuration files and create the appropriate files and directories under user control. </UL>
<UL><P>The net result of these changes should significantly simplify installation and setup as follows: <UL><P>
<LI>All platforms will be able to run without any manual user setup or the requirement for specific MicroEmacs environment variables. 
<LI>User defined directories and configuration files will be created under editor control on detecting a new user. 
<LI>Existing installations using <TT>$MEPATH</TT> will be backwards compatible with the new build. 
<LI>All platforms now support a searching jasspa sub-directory structure of <B>company</B> / <B>spelling</B> / <B>macros</B>. This was traditionally limited to the Windows Install Shield installation but has been extended across all platforms. 
<LI>Two new environment variables are provided for user or system administrator use. 
<A HREF="m5var090.html">$MEINSTALLPATH(5)</A> defines the location of the MicroEmacs standard macros and allows the built in search path to be overridden. 
<A HREF="m5var090.html">$MEUSERPATH(5)</A> defines the location of the user private configuration directory and allows the user to locate their private directory in different location. In a standard install neither of these variables will be required. 
<LI>The Microsoft Windows system defined application path will be used for user configuration files. This is applicable for roaming users where the application directory is stored on a server. 
<LI>The use of the 
<A HREF="m8fil006.html">me32.ini(8)</A> file on MicroSoft Windows environments is not required, but is still supported. 
<LI>The UNIX path searching is improved. <TT>/usr/local/microemacs</TT> will be depreciated and replaced with <TT>/usr/local/jasspa</TT> in addition other standard path locations are supported on a per-platform basis. 
<LI>On UNIX then the directory <TT>~/.jasspa</TT> shall contain the user configuration files. Optionally the <B>company</B>, <B>spelling</B> and <B>macros</B> sub-directories may be included in this directory where access to the system directory locations by the user is not permitted. 
<LI>Concept of guest has been removed. <TT>guest.emf</TT> and <TT>guest.erf</TT> removed replaced with <I>newuser</I>. 
<A HREF="m3osd000.html">user-setup(3)</A> no longer supports setting of name. 
<LI>Internal variables 
<A HREF="m5var088.html">$user-name(5)</A> and 
<A HREF="m5var089.html">$user-path(5)</A> are defined. </UL></UL><UL><P>
<LI>[040128] Fixed re-style for C/C++ comments in vertical alignment. 
<LI>[040123] &quot;<I>user-setup</I>&quot; mouse button selection fixed. 
<LI>[040123] <TT>C-x 3</TT> mapped to 
<A HREF="m2cmd151.html">split-window-horizontally(2)</A>, <TT>C-x 5</TT> mapped to 
<A HREF="m2cmd161.html">create-frame(2)</A>.

The &quot;*-lock&quot; implementation to be more like &quot;S-pick&quot; and &quot;C-pick&quot; as the keys are automatically supported (like the shift) so there are no default binds to void, the keys are only generated if there are bound. Could not implement this on MS-DOS. 
<LI>[011016] which command built in i.e. &quot;M-x which&quot;. Used for command utilities. 
<LI>[011026] A new Hide value feature when inputting strings, this is now used be the crypt and ftp Password entry. The string is shown as '*'s. 
<LI>[011025] Utilized the latest screen-update improvements to make the gdiff screen update rock solid. 
<LI>[011025] mlGetChar fix. The key &quot;return&quot; was the 78th special char, i.e. &quot;SKEY_SPEC&quot;|'N' and as the mlGetChar did not check the &quot;SKEY_SPEC&quot; bits, pressing return was like pressing 'N' so on a &quot;Y/N&quot; prompt try pressing return, its like saying No! . 
<LI>[011016] Spelling dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because of the language changes, you need to rename your personal dictionary to lsdpengb.edf for British and lsdpenus.edf for American. 
<LI>[011016] Hilighting brackets/braces as requested from user base. The hilight braces required some other subtle changes to screen-update and show-region and the addition of the &quot;rbin&quot; mode means that this version is incompatible with the last in quite a few areas. 
<LI>[011016] Fixed mouse handler (turns out that if the pick event was lost (use &quot;@cg&quot; or an error) then me would lock!). 
<LI>[011016] Extended control on indent tab and return behavior (can disable the tab behavior). 
<LI>[011016] C++ name space indentation support. 
<LI>[011016] New language support interface so spelling is not required for a language to be supported (may only want the basic alphabet setup etc). 
<LI>[011016] Changed file loading interface so all commands (like view-file) can load in &quot;bin&quot;, &quot;crypt&quot; or &quot;rbin&quot; mode. 
<LI>[010123] Reduced binary mode added (rbin).

<LI>[010630] Minor reorder to X-Windows initialization for cygwin X-Server. 
<LI>[010507] Added generic commands for the creation, deletion and reformatting of comments now used by most of the file hooks. 
<LI>[010412] Added new generic buffer setup, menu and help macros, creating the new 
<A HREF="m3osd010.html">buffer-setup(3)</A> command. Ported all existing file hooks to this new interface greatly reducing the buffer hook size while increasing its functionality and consistency. 
<LI>[010402] Added support for new 
<A HREF="m5var082.html">$buffer-backup(5)</A> variable for setting the back-up file location. 
<LI>[010312] Support for new key bindings allowing CU emulations. Nedit bindings provided as example. Major work to enable the complete re-binding of all keys so the user interface to MicroEmacs can be completely changed, this allows for example a Windows feel to be created. This required many internal ghosts to be exorcized and add new macro functions. 
<LI>[010308] User buffer configuration menu added. 
<LI>[010308] Improved Python support (Contribution PG). 
<LI>[010304] Bug fixes to hilighting logic. 
<LI>[010228] Improved dialog box for search/replace. 
<LI>[010210] Revised programming language templates; simplified the common elements used in configuring the templates. 
<LI>[010202] Added new 
<A HREF="m2cmd160.html">command-wait(2)</A> command to enable macros to wait for user dependent completion, used in &quot;gdiff&quot;. 
<LI>[010202] Changed buffer variables to except the form &quot;<TT>:&lt;buffer-name&gt;:&lt;variable&gt;</TT>&quot;, like command variables. This allows macros to access variable not defined in the current buffer. 
<LI>[010126] File &quot;autosave&quot; location changes. Control save name and location. 
<LI>[001005] OSD speedups. 
<LI>[001005] Improved and increased the file system operations via the new 
<A HREF="m2cmd158.html">file-op(2)</A> command, created better menus in the 
<A HREF="m3mac027.html">file-browser(3)</A>. 
<LI>[001010] Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more rationally. 
<LI>[001010] Improved 
<A HREF="m2cmd077.html">ipipe-shell-command(2)</A> efficiency on Windows by introducing a new thread approach to listen for activity. Implemented a shell command-line in an ipiped environment so 
<A HREF="m3mac034.html">ishell(3)</A> command is now usable on Windows platforms. 
<LI>[001010] Added new 
<A HREF="m2cmd110.html">set-position(2)</A> which can be used to store all information about the current window and 
<A HREF="m2cmd110.html">goto-position(2)</A> which will then restore them. Allowed macros to use non-letter characters for alpha marks and positions so they no longer need to clobber user ones. 
<LI>[001010] Added new &quot;-k&quot; and &quot;-u&quot; command-line options and improved &quot;-s&quot; option. 
<LI>[000922] Added GUI for tag dialogue for tags generation. 
<LI>[000922] Recursive tags support (i.e. nested directory tag traversal). 
<LI>[000810] emain.h &quot;#define&quot;'s properly supported again so MicroEmacs can be successfully compiled without options like SPELL and OSD etc. This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%. 
<LI>[000718] Source trees now maintained under CVS. 
<LI>[000719] Improved TCL/TK and Perl template support. 
<LI>[000704] Improved FTP and HTTP support. 
<LI>[000620] Java tags support. 
<LI>[000503] Revised printer support. 
<LI>[000503] Color printer support (Lexmark). </UL><P><B>2nd Release - Alpha patch - March 2000</B> <UL><P>
<LI>[000322] FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE OF RENDERED FONT SUPPORT . 
<LI>[000322] Alpha build revision contains version information for 2000/03/22 
<LI>[000322] Internal re-organisation of platform option selection. 
<LI>[000322] Minor fixes X-Windows color selection. 
<LI>[000322] Minor fixes in the OSD.

<LI>[000322] Revised UNIX Termcap support. 
<LI>[000322] New font rendering, supporting bold, italic, underline etc. All platforms modified to cope with font scheme definitions. Platforms optimized for speed. 
<LI>[000126] Beta build revision contains version information for 2000/01/26. 
<LI>[000126] Directory file copy. Within this release files in the directory listings may be selected for copy and pasting from the menu. Use the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory buffers. Copy and paste to/from a ftp directory buffer to a local drive buffer may be used to initiate an ftp transfer. (This is how these pages are uploaded). 
<LI>[000126] New command ftp opens a ftp connection using a dialog. Use may save the host connection information in a registry file. Note that the password information is exposed so be careful where this is used - if in doubt do not enter the password and you will be prompted. 
<LI>[000126] New command 
<A HREF="m3mac049.html">uniq(3)</A> operates as the UNIX of the same name. used with sort, and reduces to unique lines. 
<LI>[000126] Character translation; addition of character translation macros when moving between character sets. Accessible from Menu -&gt; Format -&gt; Change Buffer Char Set. 
<LI>[000126] Support for additional character sets, Windows GREEK, Windows TURKISH. 
<LI>[000126] Line hilighting selection with the use of the mouse and auto search. When using the mouse selection to set up the line hilighting when invoked from a <TT>right-mouse -&gt; Hilight Line -&gt; color/remove</TT> selection; the macro determines the mouse selected region and makes an appropriate decision as to how the line hilighting scheme is to be applied. The following rules apply to the mouse selection:- <UL><P>
<LI>Point in line selected (i.e. mark == point) Hilight the line only. 
<LI>Region in the line selected. Both point and mark are on the same line. Extract the selected text and hilight all lines that match the search pattern. The color &quot;remove&quot; is also pattern matched to selectively remove lines. 
<LI>Region selected mark &amp; point on different lines Block up the region with appropriate hilight. 
<LI>Note that line hilighting may be safely used in a folded buffer. </UL><P></UL><UL><P>
<LI>[000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may toggle this from the keyboard using a macro in your user.emf as follows:- 
<PRE>;&nbsp;Macro&nbsp;to&nbsp;enable&nbsp;the&nbsp;display&nbsp;of&nbsp;TAB/CR.&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;we 
;&nbsp;force&nbsp;the&nbsp;screen&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;updated.

<LI><P>[000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf). 
<LI>[000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta. 
<LI>[000112] Revised color hilighting schemes, reduced the number of colors in a number of schemes. Introduction of the Sherwood Forest color scheme (green theme obviously !!). 
<LI>[000112] Small revision to the user interface with respect to font selection. In order to make character set selection easier then the multiple choices for the box characters have been removed from Menu -&gt; Help -&gt; User Setup. These have been replaced with a new check box Extended Char Set. This box should be checked to enable the special rendering characters and enable the box characters - this is typically enabled on X-Windows and MS-Windows. 
<LI>[000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name, modification time and size. Selecting the directory column title performs a re-sort based on the selection, a further selection reverses the order of the list. 
<LI>[000112] Addition of ftp support (meu build on Windows, enabled by default on UNIX). Enables files to be edited via ftp, (read and write supported). Transfer to another system using ftp://[&lt;user&gt;[:&lt;password]@]&gt;&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]/&lt;pathname&gt;. 
<LI>[000112] Improved source code provision for foreign languages, various internal problems. Support for Russian (Windows and Cyrillic koi8-r). 
<LI>[000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date. 
<LI>[000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized wild card sequences. Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf, britishr.emf, etc.) then the following spelling rules may be added to cope with numeric sequences. The addition of these rules will spell check hexadecimal sequences and validate numeric sequences such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc. A spelling of &quot;1nd&quot; would generate a spelling error. This has not been performed for other languages so submissions for other language equivalents would be appreciated. <UL>
<PRE>;&nbsp;Add&nbsp;some&nbsp;special&nbsp;word&nbsp;rules&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;life&nbsp;easier.

<LI>[991101] Ground up implementation of the regular expression pattern matcher, following licensing problems with the GNU regex. The resultant pattern matcher is now a little faster than GNU regex and is capable of all of the standard regular expression pattern matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that double backslashes are required in the character classes [..] to allow for escape sequence short cuts such as '\n' (newline), '\t' (tab) etc. It was felt that this compromise was better than having to quote the more obscure search characters. 
<LI>[991101] Changed the hilighting and indenting syntax to be GNU regex compliant. 
<LI>[991101] Modified compare-windows to ignore white space by default, compare-windows-exact performs an exact character for character comparison.

<LI>[991101] Added tab and newline character printing in buffers. 
<LI>[991101] Introduced message line variables &quot;@mx&quot; and &quot;@mxa&quot;. 
<LI>[991101] New Games - Crossword cracker. The ideal way to cheat at crosswords. Uses the spelling dictionary to guess at the word, given a number of known letters. 
<LI>[991101] Hook file protection against globally bound keys - prevents re-binding of user defined keys within the macro. 
<LI>[991101] Search/Replace fix for exact mode. Environment variable search path fix. 
<LI>[991101] hkm4.emf added back into the release (seemed to have gone missing).

<LI>[991101] New - Color schemes, Plain; for those that do not care for an abundance of colors. 
<LI>[991101] Modified the numeric key-pad behavior to be consistent on all platforms. Problems were noted with the UNIX number lock orientation which was reversed. 
<LI>[991101] New - Color scheme variables which allow the hkXXX files to determine the level of hilighting to apply to their templates. 
<LI>[991101] Line length fix; more graceful behavior (i.e. does not crash) when the line length exceeds 64K. 
<LI>[991101] Intercept the windows 105 keyboard application key (typically right hand side of keyboard next to the control key). The key is called &quot;menu&quot;. By default this is bound in win32.emf, however users may bind it as a prefix for their own key combinations in much the same way as &quot;Alt&quot; or &quot;C-x&quot; if required. 
<LI>[991101] New; OMG's IDL language template added. 
<LI>[991101] Fix for windows short name in next-buffer. </UL><P><B>2nd Release - Beta #1 - May 1999.</B> <UL><P>
