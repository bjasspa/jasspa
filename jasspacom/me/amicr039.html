<H2><B>ORIGINS </B></H2>
<UL><P>This version of MicroEmacs is based on an early <I>MicroEmacs</I> release of 3.8 in 1988, the origins of which are unknown, except to say it was delivered on a unmarked 5 1/2&quot; floppy disk. 
<P>The program was originally ported to a Motorola MVME147 UNIX box as an alternative to <B>vi</B>. Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as it constantly crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the development of MicroEmacs '04 commenced. 
<P>Development has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole oblivious to further developments of the existing <B>MicroEmacs</B> program. This was due to no Internet access. It was not until 1996 the next version of <B>MicroEmacs</B> and <B>mewin</B> (Microsoft Windows (TM) port of the same program) was downloaded from the Internet and compared. By this time MicroEmacs '04 was radically different and we were not about to mesh the two together - that would be a step backwards. 
<P>Development of MicroEmacs '04 has been biased towards the UNIX platform, as most of the early development was performed in the UNIX domain. The first of the window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the implementation of the Microsoft Windows port. Latterly, we have seen the resurgence of the IBM-PC platform which is now commonplace. For the return port to the DOS environment, and subsequent development of the Microsoft Windows port, a UNIX like interface was required. Most existing users could not abide the primitive editors found on these machines; Microsoft Windows was an alien and hostile environment when compared with UNIX. Hence, the MicroEmacs '04 interface utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across all platforms. 
<P>For portability, MicroEmacs '04 utilizes character rendering on all platforms regardless of the window manager. Under X-Windows and Microsoft Windows, the display is still treated as a character based display, the subtle difference is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that the scroll bars, fonts etc. are not as slick as they could be, certainly under Microsoft Windows MicroEmacs '04 looks positively primitive!! Regardless of the look, the goal of a common editor across all working platforms has been achieved! </UL>

<P>1999 <UL><UL><P>
<LI>Introduction of the address and date 
<A HREF="m3osd001.html">organizer(3)</A> (replacing the existing <B>cal</B> interface) 
<LI>Generic buffer folding using 
<A HREF="m2cmd068.html">narrow-buffer(2)</A> 
<LI>Rendered cursor support on all platforms. 
<LI>Smooth scrolling mode. 
<LI>Win32s port, for Microsoft 3.1/3.11 O/S. 
<LI>Re-worked <B>translate-tcap-key</B> to generic 
<A HREF="m2cmd133.html">translate-key(2)</A> to solve many of the foreign language problems. 
<LI>Re-worked the ALT key mapping to allow conventional Emacs meta key bindings. 
<LI>Implemented Auto-Spell utility. 
<LI>Introduction of private macro variables of the form <I>.name</I> and <I>.macro.name</I>. 
<LI>Port to Sun Solaris Intel platform (2.6) 
<LI>Merged the init-hilight and hilight-token into the single 
<A HREF="m2cmd069.html">hilight(2)</A> command. Similarly for 
<A HREF="m2cmd033.html">indent(2)</A>. 
<LI>Enhanced the regexp support in 
<A HREF="m2cmd069.html">hilight</A> tokens, vastly improving it capability and usability. Similarly for indent tokens. 
<LI>Reorganized the hilighting files. Introduction of the 
<A HREF="m3osd005.html">scheme-editor(3)</A> and <I>Hilight Search</I> OSD's. 
<LI>Implemented box character override support ( 
<A HREF="m5var047.html">$system(5)</A> bit 0x10000) on Win32 and Xterm platforms. 
<LI>Microsoft Windows native console support. 
<LI><B>2nd Release - Beta #1</B> - May 1999. 
<LI>Bug fixes with multi-language support and spelling dictionaries. 
<LI>Fixed 
<A HREF="m2cmd052.html">fill-paragraph(2)</A> such that it retains the cursor position in the paragraph when invoked without arguments. 
<LI>Moved to GNU regex for search/replace engine. 
<LI>Enhanced <I>isearch</I> such that it operates in <I>*shell*</I> buffers (again). 
<LI>
<A HREF="m3mac044.html">gdiff(3)</A> macro implementation of a graphical diff to allow color annotation of differences and difference selection. Uses the output of a standard <B>diff(1)</B> utility. 
<LI>2nd port to IBM AIX. 
<LI><B>2nd Release - Beta #2</B> - November 1999 
<LI>Enhanced the 
<A HREF="m9typ004.html">latex(9)</A> support macros following various contributions from users. 
<LI>Added <I>Favorites</I> to the <I>File</I> pull down menu. This is a simple mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites list. 
<LI>Ground up implementation of the regular expression pattern matcher, following licensing problems with the GNU regex. The resultant pattern matcher is now a little faster than GNU regex and is capable of all of the standard regular expression pattern matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that double backslashes are required in the character classes <TT>[..]</TT> to allow for escape sequence short cuts such as '<TT>\n</TT>' (newline), '<TT>\t</TT>' (tab) etc. It was felt that this compromise was better than having to quote the more obscure search characters. 
<LI>Changed the hilighting and indenting syntax to be GNU regex compliant. 
<LI>Modified 
<A HREF="m2cmd020.html">compare-windows(2)</A> to ignore white space by default, 
<A HREF="m2cmd020.html">compare-windows-exact(3)</A> performs an exact character for character comparison. 
<LI>Enhanced the tags support to handle multiple tags and recursive directory tree searching. 
<LI>Implemented osd-help, a gui front end to the on-line help. Required changes to the help system which gives macros access to the on-line help buffer, needed for the index and search. 
<LI>Over-hauled the hilighting scheme files and editor to support the disabling of buffer hilighting. 
<LI>Many bugs fixed on all platforms, in particular unix cutting and pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit delay. 
<LI>Added tab and newline character printing in buffers. 
<LI>Introduced message line variables @mx and @mxa. 
<LI>Added ftp support with a new ftp 'file-browser' interface to give easy to use ftp capability. </UL></UL>
<P>2000 <UL><UL><P>
<LI>Fixed several millennium bugs :) 
<LI>Revamped the printing interface to support colors 
<LI>Started using <B>CVS(1)</B> at last, much better history from now on. 
<LI>Got the emain #define's properly supported again so options so MicroEmacs can be successfully compiled without options like SPELL and OSD etc. This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%. 
<LI>Improved the macro based tag generators to support source code trees and many new items of information, added new generation GUI. 
<LI>Greatly improved the OSD based search and replace dialog, also added the line hilight into this dialog. 
<LI>Added new -k and -u command-line options and improved -s option. 
<LI>Greatly improved and increase the file system operations via the new 
<A HREF="m2cmd158.html">file-op(2)</A> command, created better menus in the 
<A HREF="m3mac027.html">file-browser(3)</A>. 
<LI>Added new 
<A HREF="m2cmd110.html">set-position(2)</A> which can be used to store all information about the current window and 
<A HREF="m2cmd110.html">goto-position(2)</A> which will then restore them. Allowed macros to use non-letter characters for alpha marks and positions so they no longer need to clobber user ones. 
<LI>Greatly improved ipipe-shell-command efficiency on windows by introducing a new thread approach to listen for activity. Implemented a shell command-line in an ipiped environment so 
<A HREF="m3mac034.html">ishell(3)</A> command is now usable on Windows platforms. 
<LI>Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more rationally. </UL></UL>
<P>2001 <UL><UL><P>
<LI>Changed buffer variables to except the form :&lt;buffer-name&gt;:&lt;variable&gt;, like command variables. This allows macros to access variable not defined in the current buffer. 
<LI>Added new 
<A HREF="m2cmd160.html">command-wait(2)</A> command to enable macros to wait for user dependent completion, used in <B>gdiff</B>. 
<LI>Added support for new 
<A HREF="m5var082.html">$buffer-backup(5)</A> variable for setting the back-up file location. 
<LI>Major work to enable the complete rebinding of all keys so the user interface to MicroEmacs can be completely changed, this allows for example a Windows feel to be created. This required many internal ghosts to be exorcised and add new macro functions 
<LI>Added new generic buffer setup, menu and help macros, creating the new 
<A HREF="m3osd010.html">buffer-setup(3)</A> command. Ported all existing file hooks to this new interface greatly reducing the buffer hook size while increasing its functionality and consistency. 
<LI>Added generic commands for the creation, deletion and reformatting of comments now used by most of the file hooks. 
<LI><B>3rd Release</B> - July 2001. Fixed many bugs in the last 12 months as well as adding the above features.

<LI>Minor macros modification to font selection for schemes. Default guest setup font selection for cleaner <I>first</I> page. 
<LI>CVS macro update. Changed <B>cvs-diff</B> to <B>cvs-gdiff</B> and introduced a new <B>cvs-diff</B> which just gives the diff output and fixed several bugs when running with a cvs server. Also added support for the CVS/Template file when committing. 
<LI>Minor update to the CVS help page for the aforementioned (Affected all help files). 
<LI><B>4th Release</B> - August 2001. Minor bug fixes.

<P>2002 <UL><UL><P>
<LI><B>5th Release</B> - January 2002 
<LI>Applied GPL License to code base. Transition to GPL following permission from Daniel M Lawrence. 
<LI>Fix to comment-restyle in <TT>comment.emf</TT> - stops a spin. 
<LI>nroff makefile full target building the txt files. (internal). 
<LI>Added support for a $CURSOR$ tag to the etf files which sets the initial cursor position, and included h.etf as an example. 
<LI>Moved the template etfinsrt calls into the buffer-initialize macro . 
<LI>Fixed the exec fhook-cpp not working. 
<LI>Fixes to ctags for C++ function call initialisers. 
<LI>Fixed Windows Console <TT>RETURN</TT> key keyboard mapping, returning incorrect binding. 
<LI>Fixed Termcap <TT>TAB</TT> key translation. 
<LI>Fixed Termcap tparm() to use a default stack argument if not specified by default. 
<LI>Added cygwin support to the build file. 
<LI>Added extra argument to buffer-initialise. 
<LI>Added support for Euphoria language. 
<LI>Italian spelling dictionary. 
<LI>Added scheme support for fence matching colors. 
<LI>Removed global binding of TAB key from unixterm.emf and build in translation. 
<LI>Fixed cygwin makefile for latest version, added cygwin macros. 
<LI>Fixed remaining termcap crash under cygwin. 
<LI>Merged prototype cygwin code base into release, use poll() following select(). 
<LI>Fence matching added to user sertup (user-setup -&gt; Platform -&gt; Fence Display). 
<LI>Reworked the buffer hooks such that mybhook/myehook can be defined. 
<LI>Fixed a corking crash! (load random.c and do 2222 replace-string &quot;\n&quot; &quot;&quot;). 
<LI>hklatex.emf item-list support (hit f7). 
<LI>hklatex.emf has a greatly improved pseudo hilighting. 
<LI>Tweaked the @fs variable to improve its usability. 
<LI>set-position can now store the mark position. 
<LI>Fixes to windows file times. 
<LI>New caps-lock, num-lock, scroll-lock and pause key support for win32 &amp; unix. The *-lock implementation to be more like S-pick and C-pick as the keys are automatically supported (like the shift) so there are no default binds to void, the keys are only generated if there are bound. Could not implement this on DOS. 
<LI>which command built in i.e. &quot;M-x which&quot;. Used for command utilities. 
<LI>A new Hide value feature when inputting strings, this is now used be the crypt and ftp Password entry. The string is shown as '*'s. 
<LI>Utilised the latest screen-update improvements to make the gdiff screen update rock solid. 
<LI>mlGetChar fix. The key &quot;return&quot; was the 78th special char, i.e. SKEY_SPEC|'N' and as the mlGetChar did not check the SKEY_SPEC bits, pressing return was like pressing 'N' so on a Y/N prompt try pressing return, its like saying No. 
<LI>Spelling dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because of the language changes, you need to rename your personal dictionary to lsdpengb.edf for British and lsdpenus.edf for American. 
<LI>Hilighting brackets/braces as requested from user base. The hilight braces required some other subtle changes to screen-update and show-region and the addition of the rbin mode means that this version is incompatible with the last in quite a few areas. 
<LI>Fixed mouse handler (turns out that if the pick event was lost (use @cg or an error) then me would lock!). 
<LI>Extended control on indent tab and return behaviour (can disable the tab behaviour). 
<LI>C++ namespace indentation support. 
<LI>New language support interface so spelling is not required for a language to be supported (may only want the basic alphabet setup etc). 
<LI>Changed file loading interface so all commands (like view-file) can load in bin,crypt or rbin mode. 
<LI>Reduced binary mode added (rbin).

<LI>Added LATEX abbreviation file and updated template to load abbreviation file. 
<LI>Added binary add mode to the CVS menu. 
<LI>JASSPA Structured Text (still prototyping - jst). Macros to convert structured text into other formats.

<P>2003 <UL><UL><P>
<LI>Big return value change to get functions consistent - found that the return values of low level line functions where different to high level functions making the code hard to read and dangerous. Also needed a consistent triple value return (true false and error) so change meABORT to -1 across the board. 
<LI>Build fix for SUNOS. 
<LI>Fixed compiler warning in spawn.c.

<LI>Ipipe fix for SUNOS. Big return value change to get functions consistent - found that the return values of low level line functions where different to high level functions making the code hard to read and dangerous. Also needed a consistent triple value return (true false and error) so change meABORT to -1 across the board. changed the line flag implementation to be more flexible and variable in size so UE has a smaller memory usage and ME has line flags available. Improved the AMark setting and deleting. Added a Protected Line flag and vastly improved the narrowing. Renamed most function in line.c to make them more readable. 
<LI>Latest versions of build.txt, cygwin.txt, faq.txt and readme.txt. 
<LI>Abbreviation, Changed 
<A HREF="m2cmd022.html">copy-region(2)</A> call to not expand the narrows, numeric argument added to prevent narrow copy.

<LI>Changed the logic of the 'd' flag so that it disables the displaying of the item type, changed button rendering so that it adheres to this so a single char button can be created Added new 'O' combo box item type which is a mixture between an entry box and a sub-menu item. 
<LI>Fixed a nasty bug to do with file hooks that load other files and the find-file command manipulating the buffHistNo incorrectly so the wrong buffer is shown - obscure!
