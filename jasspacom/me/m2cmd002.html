<H2><B>NAME </B></H2>
<UL><P>add-dictionary - Declare existence of a spelling dictionary </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><I>n</I> <B>add-dictionary</B> &quot;<I>file</I>&quot; </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>add-dictionary</B> adds the given dictionary (specified by the given <I>file</I>) to the dictionary list. Note that the <I>file</I> may omit the <B>.edf</B> extension, this is automatically added. 
<P>The command accepts a numeric argument '<I>n</I>' which determines the actions to be undertaken. When <I>n</I> is omitted then the dictionary is marked for loading (on demand) - this is the standard invocation used in the start up files. 
<P>If an argument of <B>0</B> is given the dictionary is created but it is not marked for loading, this can be used to create an empty dictionary. 
<P>If an argument of <B>-1</B> is given the contents of the dictionary are dumped into the current buffer, used for dictionary maintenance. The two main uses of this command are discussed below. </UL>
<H2>Dictionary Loading </H2>
<UL><P>A call to <B>add-dictionary</B> with no numeric argument does not perform an immediate load of the dictionary, instead the dictionary is only loaded on demand, i.e. when a call to 
<A HREF="m2cmd125.html">spell(2)</A> (usually via 
<A HREF="m3osd002.html">spell-word(3)</A> or 
<A HREF="m3osd002.html">spell-buffer(3)</A>) is made, this ensures that the start up time for MicroEmacs does not become too long. When the dictionary is loaded it is checked for efficiency, if found to be inefficient it is automatically optimized and flagged as changed. On exiting MicroEmacs, the user is prompted to save any dictionary that has be altered or optimized. 
<P>The spelling search order is made from the last dictionary added to the first, as soon as a word is found in a dictionary the search is halted. This implies that if a word has been defined incorrectly in one dictionary, but correct in another, the order in which the dictionaries are added determines the result. 
<P>The number of dictionaries allowed is unlimited but note that any words added are always added to the LAST dictionary. The size of the dictionary is restricted to about 16Mb, the size is NOT tested when words are added and if this size is exceeded the results are undefined. However, it is unlikely that this limit will be reached, the largest dictionary created to date is 0.8Mb. 
<P>A new main dictionary may be created as follows:- 
<P><B>1)</B> 
<BR><UL>Find a file containing an <B>ispell(1)</B> compatible list of words. </UL>
<P><B>2)</B> 
<BR><UL>
<A HREF="m2cmd045.html">execute-file(2)</A> spellutl.emf to define macro 
<A HREF="m3mac023.html">spell-add-word(3)</A>. </UL>
<P><B>3)</B> 
<BR><UL>Start up MicroEmacs '04 and execute the command <B>add-dictionary</B> giving an appropriate new dictionary name. </UL>
<P><B>4)</B> 
<BR><UL>Load up the file containing the words and execute the command 
<A HREF="m3mac023.html">spell-add-word(3)</A> with a very large argument so all the words are added. </UL>
<P><B>5)</B> 
<BR><UL>Save the dictionary by either executing the command 
<A HREF="m2cmd112.html">save-dictionary(2)</A> or exiting. </UL></UL>
<H2>Dictionary Dump </H2>
<UL><P>A call to <B>add-dictionary</B> with a numeric argument <I>n</I> of -1 causes the contents of the given dictionary to be dumped into the current buffer (make sure you are in an empty buffer or <B>*scratch*</B>) where: 
<UL><P><TT>xxxx</TT>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Good&nbsp;word&nbsp;<TT>xxxx</TT>&nbsp;with&nbsp;no&nbsp;spell&nbsp;rules&nbsp;allowed 
<BR><TT>xxxx/abc</TT>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Good&nbsp;word&nbsp;<TT>xxxx</TT>&nbsp;with&nbsp;spell&nbsp;rules&nbsp;<TT>abc</TT>&nbsp;allowed 
<BR><TT>xxxx&gt;yyyy</TT>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Erroneous&nbsp;word&nbsp;with&nbsp;an&nbsp;auto-replace&nbsp;to&nbsp;<TT>yyyy</TT> </UL>
<P>The dump of the dictionary may be edited, allowing erroneous entries to be removed. The macro file <TT>spellutl.emf</TT> contains macros 
<A HREF="m3mac022.html">edit-dictionary(3)</A> and 
<A HREF="m3mac022.html">restore-dictionary(3)</A> which enable the user to edit a dictionary. </UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>MicroEmacs '04 is supplied with a dictionaries for American and British English, it is strongly suggested that these dictionaries are <B>NOT</B> modified in anyway. Ensure that the dictionary is protected by loading the base dictionaries first, followed by a personal dictionary. New words added during spelling will then be added to the personal dictionary rather than the main dictionary. </UL>
<H2><B>EXAMPLE </B></H2>
<UL><P>The MicroEmacs '04 start-up file <B>me.emf</B> executes <B>language.emf</B> which in turn executes the user language setup file, for example <B>american.emf</B>, which adds the main language dictionaries and rules. <B>language.emf</B> then adds the user's dictionary, this process can be simplified to:- <UL>
<PRE>;&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;main&nbsp;American&nbsp;dictionary 
add-dictionary&nbsp;&quot;lsdmenus&quot; 

;&nbsp;reset&nbsp;the&nbsp;spell&nbsp;rules 
0&nbsp;add-spell-rule 
;&nbsp;Now&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;American&nbsp;spell&nbsp;rules 
-2&nbsp;add-spell-rule&nbsp;&quot;A&quot;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;&nbsp;&quot;re&quot;&nbsp;;&nbsp;As&nbsp;in&nbsp;enter&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;reenter 
-2&nbsp;add-spell-rule&nbsp;&quot;I&quot;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;&nbsp;&quot;in&quot;&nbsp;;&nbsp;As&nbsp;in&nbsp;disposed&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;indisposed 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. 
;&nbsp;Now&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;user&nbsp;dictionary 
add-dictionary&nbsp;$MENAME
