<UL><P>Printing; My printer is not supported ? </UL>
<H2><B>ANSWER </B></H2>
<UL><P>We are in the process of providing native postscript generation - UNIX users can stream their output through &quot;a2ps&quot; and then into their standard printer queues. 
<P>Windows, the support is already built in. 
<P>For DOS then you need to get your printer manual out and sort out how to map the printer codes onto fonts. The printer codes are added to &quot;<TT>printer.erf</TT>&quot;. We have already provided support for the HP DeskJet printer (PCL), look at this printer definition for some help as to the type of information that you need to set up. It's all a bit fiddley, but you do not get much choice if you want more than plain ASCII out.
