<UL><P>start-up - Editor startup callback command 
<BR>shut-down - Editor exit callback command </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>start-up</B> 
<BR><B>shut-down</B> </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>By default <B>start-up</B> is not defined, if the command is defined (via a user macro) then it is executed immediately after MicroEmacs '02 has completed its initialization. 
<P>This command may initially seem redundant as the user may execute any command at start-up by editing the &quot;<TT>me.emf</TT>&quot; file or using the '<B>@</B>' command-line argument. At the point of &quot;<TT>me.emf</TT>&quot; file execution none of the files specified on the command-line will be loaded, thus any actions required on the given command-line files will not work (the only buffer present will be the &quot;<B>*scratch*</B>&quot; buffer). 
<P>The <B>start-up</B> command is executed AFTER the execution of &quot;<TT>me.emf</TT>&quot; and initialization of buffers, but before MicroEmacs '02 waits for user input. 
<P>The <B>shut-down</B> command is also not defined by default, but if it is defined during the running of MicroEmacs the command will be called when MicroEmacs exits. The command is not called if MicroEmacs has to perform an emergency exit (due to the system being shut down or process being killed etc). </UL>
