<H2><B>QUESTION (01) </B></H2>
<UL><P>Languages; Are any foreign languages supported other than English ?? </UL>
<H2><B>ANSWER </B></H2>
<UL><P>Unfortunately as we started with V3.8 as a base many years ago, we missed the distribution with foreign language extensions. We have not incorporated them into the release. 
<P>The May 1999 release improves the language support by supporting the ISO-Latin character sets. 
<P>We do have spelling dictionaries for French, Spanish, Portuguese and German. Other languages may be supported by transforming native <B>ispell(1)</B> dictionaries. 
<P>If there is enough interest in this release from people with foreign languages then we may consider including support for foreign language(s). However we would be very much reliant on external help for local testing and translation. We would be open to suggestions.
