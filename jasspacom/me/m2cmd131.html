<UL><P>shell-command - Perform an operating system command </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><I>n</I> <B>shell-command</B> &quot;<I>string</I>&quot; </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>shell-command</B> performs an operating system call with the given <I>string</I> as its argument. The command only fails if the shell-command call returns -1. The 
<A HREF="m5var041.html">$result(5)</A> variable is set the return value and can be used to test the result. 
<P>The argument <I>n</I> can be used to change the default behavior of the shell-command, <I>n</I> is a bit based flag where:- 
<P><B>0x01</B> 
<BR><UL>When set shell-command waits for the command to complete, this is the default behavior. When not set the command is launched and forgotten about, the value returned in 
<A HREF="m5var041.html">$result(5)</A> will not reflect the exit code of the executed process itself. </UL>
<P><B>0x04</B> 
<BR><UL>Disable the use of the command-line processor to launch the program (win32 versions only). By default the &quot;<B>command</B>&quot; is launched by executing the command: 
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%COMSPEC%&nbsp;/c&nbsp;command 
</PRE></UL>
<UL><P>Where <TT>%COMSPEC%</TT> is typically command.com. If this bit is set, the &quot;<B>command</B>&quot; is launched directly. </UL>
<P><B>0x08</B> 
<BR><UL>Detach the launched process from MicroEmacs (win32 versions only). By default the command is launched as a child process of MicroEmacs with a new console. With this bit set the process is completely detached from MicroEmacs instead. </UL>
<P><B>0x10</B> 
<BR><UL>Disable the command name mangling (win32 versions only). By default any '<TT>/</TT>' characters found in the command name (the first argument only) are converted to '<TT>\</TT>' characters to make it Windows compliant. </UL>
<P><B>0x20</B> 
<BR><UL>Displays the new process window (win32 versions only), by default the window is hidden. </UL>
<P><B>0x100</B> 
<BR><UL>When set the command-line to be run is the first line of buffer <I>string</I>, this feature can be used to overcome the default 1024 character command-line limit. When a multiple-line command-line is required, a negative argument can be given to 
<A HREF="m2cmd076.html">insert-string(2)</A>. </UL>
<P><B>0x200</B> 
<BR><UL>No wait option, when set the the command is run without waiting for any completion status. This allows processes to be run and then forgotten about e.g. a Word processor, Adobe Acrobat reader etc. </UL></UL>
