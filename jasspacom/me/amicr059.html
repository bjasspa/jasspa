<H2><B>QUESTION (18) </B></H2>
<UL><P>Windows Autosave and Backup files; are these potentially a problem ? </UL>
<H2><B>ANSWER </B></H2>
<UL><P>For windows '95 up until OEM service release 2, the OS could not distinguish the difference between the files:- <UL>
<PRE>.xxx 
.xxx~ 
</PRE></UL>
<P>on a read, we have managed to find a work around for this, however we would advise that the 3 letter extension is adhered to for these releases. For releases of '95 OEM service release 2 and greater, '98 and NT we have not found a problem with any of the auto save and backup naming. 
<P>Obviously, the backup naming will depend on the native file system. For instance if your system administrator has not enabled long file names on your Novel server.
