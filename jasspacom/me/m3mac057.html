<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>The cvs and sub-commands provide MicroEmacs with an interface to <B>cvs(1)</B>. <B>CVS</B> is a version control system; using it, you can record the history of your source file modifications. CVS is licensed under the GNU General Public License and is freely available on the Internet, see the documentation provided with CVS for more information on its features and use. 
<P>The MicroEmacs <B>cvs</B> command opens up a modified 
<A HREF="m3mac027.html">file-browser(3)</A> with an additional &quot;<TT>*cvs-console*</TT>&quot; window. The &quot;<TT>*files*</TT>&quot; window includes additional columns showing the CVS state, revision and repository date. The functionality of the file-browser is the same as a non-CVS folder with the exception that additional CVS item controls are located in the mouse context menu (opened by clicking the right mouse button in the <TT>*files*</TT> buffer). This menu item opens another sub-menu providing access to the following items: 
<P><B>Checkout files</B> 
<BR><UL>Checks out a file or directory from the repository into the current directory. The file or directory is specified by typing the name into a dialog which is opened when this option is selected. This runs the command &quot;<TT>cvs&nbsp;checkout&nbsp;&lt;file&gt;</TT>&quot;. </UL>
<P><B>Update files</B> 
<BR><UL>Updates the currently selected files, files are selected by clicking the left button to the left of the required file name. Multiple files may be selected by 'dragging' a hilight region over the required files. This runs the command &quot;<TT>cvs update &lt;files&gt;</TT>&quot;. </UL>
<P><B>Commit files</B> 
<BR><UL>Commits any changes made to the selected files back to the CVS repository. This runs the command &quot;<TT>cvs commit &lt;files&gt;</TT>&quot;. </UL>
<P><B>Diff files</B> 
<BR><UL>Displays any differences between the selected files and the CVS repository version in the <I>*cvs-console*</I> window. This runs the command &quot;<TT>cvs diff &lt;files&gt;</TT>&quot;. </UL>
<P><B>Log files</B> 
<BR><UL>Displays the CVS logs for the selected files in the <I>*cvs-console*</I> window. This runs the command &quot;<TT>cvs log &lt;files&gt;</TT>&quot;. </UL>
<P><B>Status files</B> 
<BR><UL>Displays the CVS status for each of the selected files in the <I>*cvs-console*</I> window. This runs the command &quot;<TT>cvs status -v &lt;files&gt;</TT>&quot;. </UL>
<P><B>Add files</B> 
<BR><UL>Adds the selected files to the CVS repository. Note this command only performs the local add, a <B>CVS commit</B> is required to make the addition permanent. This runs the command &quot;<TT>cvs add &lt;files&gt;</TT>&quot;. </UL>
<P><B>Remove files</B> 
<BR><UL>This command is deliberately not implemented as its far to dangerous! Instead it opens a dialog informing the user to use the <B>cvs-remove</B> command instead. </UL>
<P><B>Graphical diff</B> 
<BR><UL>This command opens a 
<A HREF="m3mac044.html">gdiff(3)</A> window showing the differences between the currently selected file and the CVS repository version. Note this command only works with a single file. </UL>
<P><B>Resolve conflicts</B> 
<BR><UL>This command may be used to resolve merge conflicts created by a <I>CVS</I> <I>update</I> operation. The command opens a 
<A HREF="m3mac044.html">gdiff(3)</A> window showing the areas of conflict allowing the user to select the correct version and saving the resultant version back to the local file. Note this command only works with a single file. </UL>
<P><B>Clear cvs console</B> 
<BR><UL>Clears the <I>*cvs-console*</I> buffer. 
</UL><P>The <B>cvs-add</B> command adds the current buffers file to the repository. Note that this command only performs the local addition, a <I>CVS</I> <I>commit</I> is required to make the addition permanent. 
<P>The <B>cvs-checkout</B> command checks out a file or directory from the repository into the current directory. The user specifies the file on the message line. 
<P>The <B>cvs-commit</B> command commits any changes made to the currently buffer's file (including additions) to the repository. The user is prompted for a commit log message. 
<P>The <B>cvs-diff</B> command opens a <I>*cvs-diff*</I> window displaying the differences between the current buffer's local file and repository version. If the current buffer is a directory list it will list all the differences found in all files within the directory. 
<P>The <B>cvs-gdiff</B> command opens a 
<A HREF="m3mac044.html">gdiff(3)</A> window displaying the differences between the current buffer's local file and repository version. 
<P>The <B>cvs-log</B> command opens a <I>*cvs-log*</I> window displaying the CVS log of the current buffer's file. 
<P>The <B>cvs-remove</B> command removes the current buffer's file from the repository - PLEASE NOTE THIS CAN LEAD TO LOST DATA!!! This command only performs the local removal; as it deletes the buffer and file the <B>cvs-commit</B> command cannot be used to commit the removal to the CVS repository. Instead the main <B>cvs</B> file-browser menu or <B>cvs(1)</B> itself must be used. 
<P>The <B>cvs-resolve-conflicts</B> command may be used to resolve any conflicts created by CVS when the current buffer's file is updated. The command opens a gdiff window displaying the areas of conflict, the user may then select the correct version in each case and save the resultant new version over the local file. 
<P>The <B>cvs-state</B> command opens a <I>*cvs-state*</I> window listing the state of any file in the current directory which is not up-to-date. Note that unlike most cvs sub commands this command executes over all files in the current buffer's file directory. 
<P>The <B>cvs-update</B> command updates all files in the current directory, the output being reported to a new <I>*cvs-update*</I> window. Note that unlike most cvs sub commands this command executes over all files in the current buffer's file directory. </UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>cvs</B> and sub-commands are macros defined in file <TT>cvs.emf</TT>. 
<P>By default MicroEmacs's <B>cvs</B> commands skip all files ignored by <B>cvs(1)</B>. This is configured by the variable <B>.cvs.filter</B>, defining this variable to <TT>0</TT> disables this special filtering. </UL>
