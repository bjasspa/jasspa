<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>cygwin</B> creates an interactive BASH shell window within a MicroEmacs buffer window, providing a UNIX command line facility within the Microsoft Windows environment. This is a preferable environment to the MS-DOS shell and is certainly far more comfortable for those familiar with UNIX. 
<P>Within the window BASH commands may be entered and executed, the results are shown in the window. Within the context of the BASH shell window then directory naming conforms to the <B>cygwin</B> standard conventions (as opposed to the Microsoft directory naming). 
<P>On running <B>cygwin</B> a new buffer is created called <TT>*cygwin*</TT> which contains the shell. Executing the command again creates a new shell window called <TT>*cygwin1*</TT>, and so on. If a cygwin window is killed off then the available window is used next time the command is run. 
<P>Additional controls are available within the shell window to control the editors interaction with the window. The operating mode is shown as a digit on the buffer mode line, this should typically show &quot;3&quot;, which corresponds to <I>F3</I>. The operating modes are mapped to keys as follows:- 
<P><B>F2</B> 
<BR><UL>Locks the window and allows local editing to be performed. All commands entered into the window are interpreted by the editors. <B>F2</B> mode is typically entered to cut and paste from the window, search for text strings etc. In mode 2, a <B>2</B> is shown on the mode line. </UL>
<P><B>F3</B> 
<BR><UL>The normal operating mode, text typed into the window is presented to the shell window. Translation of MicroEmacs commands (i.e. beginning-of-word) are translated and passed to the shell. For interactive use this is the default mode. In mode 3, a <B>3</B> is shown on the mode line. </UL>
<P><B>F4</B> 
<BR><UL>All input is passed to the shell, no MicroEmacs commands are interpreted and keys are passed straight to the shell window. This mode is used where none of the keys to be entered are to be interpreted by MicroEmacs. Note that you have to un-toggle the F4 mode before you can swap buffers as this effectively locks the editor into the window. </UL>
<P><B>F5</B> 
<BR><UL>Clears the buffer contents. This simply erases all of the historical information in the buffer. The operation of the shell is unaffected. </UL>
<P>To exit the shell then end the shell session using &quot;<TT>exit</TT>&quot; or &quot;<TT>C-d</TT>&quot; as normal and then close the buffer. A short cut &quot;<TT>C-c C-k</TT>&quot; is available to kill off the pipe. However, it is not recommended that this method is used as it effectively performs a hard kill of the buffer and attached process 
<P><B>%cygwin-path</B> is a user defined variable that defines the file system location of the <I>cygwin</I> directory, this is typically <TT>c:/cygwin</TT>. If <I>cygwin</I> is located at a different location then the variable MUST be defined within the user start up script in order for the <B>cygwin</B> command to start the shell. With a default installation of <I>cygwin</I> then the settings are typically defined as:- 
<P><B>Current Release</B> <UL>
<PRE>set-variable&nbsp;%cygwin-path&nbsp;&quot;c:/cygwin&quot; 
</PRE></UL>
<P><B>%cygwin-hilight</B> is a boolean flag which controls how the cygwin command shell window is hilighted. This value MUST be defined within the user start up script prior to executing cygwin if hilighting is to be disabled; by default hilighting is enabled. A value of 0 disables shell hilighting i.e. <UL>
<PRE>set-variable&nbsp;%cygwin-hilight&nbsp;0 
</PRE></UL>
<P><B>%cygwin-prompt</B> is an optional variable that is used in conjunction with <B>%cygwin-hilight</B>, it defines the hilighting string identifying the prompt. This allows the prompt to be rendered with a different color. The default prompt is <TT>bash-x.yyr$</TT> and may be hilighted using a definition:- <UL>
<PRE>set-variable&nbsp;%cygwin-prompt&nbsp;&quot;bash-2.01$&quot; 
</PRE></UL>
<P>The user typically overrides the prompt definition within the BASH startup file, a more appropriate definition of the prompt may be:- <UL>
<PRE>set-variable&nbsp;%cygwin-prompt&nbsp;&quot;^[a-z]*@[^&gt;]*&gt;&quot; 
</PRE></UL>
</UL><H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>The <B>cygwin</B> command uses the 
<A HREF="m2cmd077.html">ipipe-shell-command(2)</A> to manage the pipe between the editor and the <B>bash</B> shell. The window is controlled by the macro file <TT>hkcygwin.emf</TT> which controls the interaction with the shell. 
<P>The macro <B>cygwin</B> in <TT>hkcygwin.emf</TT> defines the parameter setup to connect to the cygwin bash shell, installed in the default location <TT>c:/cygwin</TT>. If your installation of cygwin is in a different location then correct the macro to match your install location, preferably correct by creating a <I>mycygwin.emf</I> file in your user directory simply containing a re-defined <B>cygwin</B> macro. 
<P>If you have exported some of the cygwin environment variables in your <TT>autoexec.bat</TT> then you will have to figure out for yourself what variables macro <I>cygwin</I> needs to export - the current configuration is for a vanilla install. 
<P>The <B>bash</B> shell is executed with options <B>-i</B>, for interactive shell and <B>-m</B> to enable job control. 
<P>As of the 2004 release then the <B>Cygwin</B>/<B>Cygnus</B> support has been revised in light of the changes in <B>cygwin</B> <UL><P>
<LI>Renamed the command from <B>cygnus</B> to <B>cygwin</B>. 
<LI>Following a change in the <B>bash(1)</B> command line operation, which now no longer echos user input, then the user input is processed by MicroEmacs. This does cause some problems with completion as the Cygwin environment has a different name space. The completion still requires some more work, but sufficient for smaller tasks. </UL></UL>
<H2><B>TESTED CONFIGURATIONS </B></H2>
<UL><P>This configuration has only been tested on a Windows 2000 installation, whether this works on Windows NT/XP/95/98 is unknown. 
<P>We have only been running &quot;make&quot; operations in the shell and do not know how the likes of &quot;more&quot;, &quot;man&quot; or anything other terminal interaction works. 
<P><B>Tested Configurations</B> 
<BR><UL>Windows 2K (Pentium-4) and Windows 2K (SunPCi-III) </UL>
<UL><P>cygwin latest version as of February 2004. </UL></UL>
<H2><B>BUGS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>Break Key</B> 
<BR><UL>A break in a bash shell is <TT>C-c</TT>, the macros define the key <TT>C-c&nbsp;C-c</TT> to perform the break. If the shell environment is not configured then this will cause the shell to close down. Configuring bash resolves this problem. </UL>
<P><B>Completion</B> 
<BR><UL>Completion processing needs to be improved. The directory location is retrieved from <B>bash(1)</B> on each command line prompt, this is used for file completion. There is no command completion. Room for some improvement here. </UL></UL>
