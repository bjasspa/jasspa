<H2><B>NAME </B></H2>
<UL><P>$window-flags - Current window setup flags </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>$window-flags</B> <I>bitmask</I>; Default is <TT>0</TT> </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>The <B>$window-flags</B> variable is used to set or get various behavioural characteristic settings of the current window, it is a bit based flag where: 
<P><B>0x001</B> 
<BR><UL>If set the width of the window is locked, calls to 
<A HREF="m2cmd153.html">resize-all-windows(2)</A> will maintained the width of this window whenever possible. </UL>
<P><B>0x002</B> 
<BR><UL>If set the depth of the window is locked, calls to 
<A HREF="m2cmd153.html">resize-all-windows(2)</A> will maintained the depth of this window whenever possible. </UL>
<P><B>0x004</B> 
<BR><UL>If set the buffer being displayed by the window is locked, the user can still manually change the buffer being displayed (by using commands like 
<A HREF="m2cmd091.html">find-buffer(2)</A>) but commands that pop-up buffers (such as 
<A HREF="m2cmd065.html">help(2)</A> or 
<A HREF="m2cmd057.html">find-tag(2)</A>) will not use this window. </UL>
<P><B>0x008</B> 
<BR><UL>When set the command 
<A HREF="m2cmd020.html">compare-windows(2)</A> will ignore this window. </UL>
<P><B>0x010</B> 
<BR><UL>When set the commands like 
<A HREF="m2cmd095.html">previous-window(2)</A> and 
<A HREF="m2cmd095.html">next-window(2)</A> will skip this window unless the numeric argument given to the command is used to override the flag setting. </UL>
<P><B>0x020</B> 
<BR><UL>When set the command 
<A HREF="m2cmd036.html">delete-other-windows(2)</A> will not delete this window unless the numeric argument given to the command is used to override the flag setting. </UL>
<P><B>0x040</B> 
<BR><UL>When set the command 
<A HREF="m2cmd036.html">delete-window(2)</A> will not delete this window unless the numeric argument given to the command is used to override the flag setting. </UL>
<P><B>0x080</B> 
<BR><UL>When set the window cannot be split using either the 
<A HREF="m2cmd151.html">split-window-horizontally(2)</A> or 
<A HREF="m2cmd128.html">split-window-vertically(2)</A> commands. </UL>
<P><B>0x100</B> 
<BR><UL>If not set the window cannot be deleted if it is the only window without this bit set. This more esoteric feature is utilized by the toolbar, all toolbar windows have this bit set which means that the main user window cannot be delete. </UL></UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>The $window-flags setting is not preserved during a window splitting operation (i.e. using a command like 
<A HREF="m2cmd128.html">split-window-vertically(2)</A>) as the persistence of these settings can lead to unexpected behaviour. 
<P>The toolbar uses bit 0x1000 to indicate that the window is displaying a toolbar tool, this bit should not be used by users and its value should be maintained. </UL>
