<UL><P>Key modifier which acts as the ESC key; what is it ? 
<P>What is the modifier key which acts as the ESC key ? Having to type ESCAPE and then f to move one word forward is very boring. 
<P>With Gnu Emacs (on Unix systems), there is a &quot;meta&quot; modifier key which is a shortcut for pressing ESCAPE followed by the command key. The &quot;meta&quot; key should be the &quot;Alt&quot; key. </UL>
<H2><B>ANSWER </B></H2>
<UL><P>The &quot;meta&quot; key is the &quot;Alt&quot; key. But 'F' is the Main menu hot-key for the 'File' sub-menu so by default 'A-f' will open the File sub-menu. This can be disabled by clearing bit 0x2000 in the $system variable. This option can now be set using user-setup (Alt -&gt; Main Menu).
