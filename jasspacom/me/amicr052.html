<H2><B>QUESTION (11) </B></H2>
<UL><P>Mouse support under Microsoft windows is strange !! </UL>
<H2><B>ANSWER </B></H2>
<UL><P>The mouse operation under Microsoft windows (and DOS) is biased towards a 3-button mouse operation (Logitech is ideal !!), operating in a similar way to UNIX. i.e. &lt;select&gt; operation gets text &lt;Middle button&gt; yanks text back. 
<P>This stems from the fact that we all came from UNIX backgrounds. We have had a number of comments about this already and do plan to address this issue. 
<P><B>Note:-</B> Those of you that have already had a little dip into the operation of the mouse will have probably worked out that the whole of the visible mouse/screen interaction is driven through macros, so this functionality is actually a macro change.
