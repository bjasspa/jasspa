<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>The ClearCase and sub-commands provide MicroEmacs with an interface to <B>IBM Rational Software</B> <B>ClearCase(1)</B>. <B>ClearCase</B> is a version control system; using it, you can record the history of your source file modifications. ClearCase is licensed from IBM Rational and is widely used in a commercial environment, see the documentation provided with ClearCase for more information on its features and use. 
<P>The <B>ClearCase</B> directory should be defined to MicroEmacs using 
<A HREF="m3mac085.html">cc-setup(3)</A> which enables extensions in the 
<A HREF="m3mac027.html">file-browser(3)</A> with an additional &quot;<TT>*cc-console*</TT>&quot; window. The &quot;<TT>*files*</TT>&quot; window includes additional columns showing the ClearCase state, revision and repository date. The functionality of the file-browser is the same as a non-ClearCase folder with the exception that additional ClearCase item controls are located in the mouse context menu (opened by clicking the right mouse button in the <TT>*files*</TT> buffer). This menu item opens another sub-menu providing access to the items below. When selecting commands than a pop-up check-box may be displayed which allows options to be selected for the command. 
<P><B>Current State</B> 
<BR><UL>Checks the state of selected file(s) or directory against the repository. Differences detected are shown in the <TT>*cc-state*</TT> window. This provides a quick method of determining the working directory state. </UL>
<UL><P>The <TT>*cc-state*</TT> buffer supports some of the same features as a directory listing, the files can be loaded (using <TT>return</TT> or left click on the file name), selected (using space or left mouse button on the left hand edge) and ClearCase commands executed from the window operate either on the selected files or the listed files if no files are selected. </UL>
<P><B>Update Elements</B> 
<BR><UL>Updates the currently selected files, files are selected by clicking the left button to the left of the required file name. Multiple files may be selected by 'dragging' a hilight region over the required files. </UL>
<P><B>Clear CC console</B> 
<BR><UL>Clears the <I>*cc-console*</I> buffer. 
</UL><P>The following sections describe some of the ClearCase commands that are available, a full list of commands may be found using 
<A HREF="m2cmd009.html">command-apropos(2)</A> searching for <B>cc</B> which provides a full list of all of the ClearCase related commands. 
<P>The <B>cc-add</B> command adds the current buffer file to the repository. 
<P>The <B>cc-checkout</B> command checks out a file or directory from the repository into the current directory, the read-only status of the file is changed to read-write, the user is prompted for a comment which will be used on a subsequent check-in operation. The user specifies the file on the message line. 
<P>The <B>cc-checkin</B> command commits any changes made to the currently buffer's file (including additions) to the repository. The user is prompted for a commit log message, the file state will change to read-only. 
<P>The <B>cc-diff</B> command opens a <I>*cc-diff*</I> window displaying the differences between the current buffer's local file and repository version. If the current buffer is a directory list it will list all the differences found in all files within the directory. 
<P>The <B>cc-delete</B> command removes the current buffer's file from the repository. 
<P>The <B>cc-state</B> command opens a <I>*cc-state*</I> window listing the state of any file in the current directory which is not up-to-date. Note that unlike most ClearCase sub commands this command executes over all files in the current buffer's file directory. 
<P>The <B>cc-update</B> command updates all files in the current directory, the output being reported to a new <I>*cc-update*</I> window. Note that unlike most ClearCase sub commands this command executes over all files in the current buffer's file directory. </UL>
<H2>Setup </H2>
<UL><P><B>cc-setup</B> provides a dialog interface to configure the MicroEmacs ClearCase interface if required. The VOB view location in the file system should be added for each view that is to be access by MicroEmacs. 
<P>A <B>Tools</B> tab exists to configure each of the <B>cleartool(1)</B> options, these may be configured to suite the users preferences. 
<P><B>cc-setup</B> may also be accessed from 
<A HREF="m3osd000.html">user-setup(3)</A> from the <B>Miscellaneous</B> configuration. </UL>
<H2>ClearCase File Browser </H2>
<UL><P>The <B>ClearCase File Browser</B> is an extension to the 
<A HREF="m3mac027.html">file-browser(3)</A> and shows the state of ClearCase files in a directory listing. </UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>ClearCase</B> and sub-commands are macros defined in file <TT>clearcs.emf</TT>. </UL>
