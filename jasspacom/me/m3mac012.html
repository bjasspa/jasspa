<UL><P>Mahjongg - MicroEmacs '06 version of the solitaire Mah Jongg game </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>Mahjongg</B> </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>Mah Jongg is an ancient Chinese game usually played by four players with tiles similar to dominos. This is a MicroEmacs '06 version which was inspired by the X-Windows version of the same game. The X-Windows version for the solitaire game originally seen on the PC and later ported to SunView. </UL>
<H2>Theory Of Play </H2>
<UL><P>The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board. Tiles are removed by matching two identical tiles which have either an open left edge or open right edge. The only exception to this rule is that any open &quot;<I>flower</I>&quot; tile (bamboo <TT>[BAMB]</TT>, orchid <TT>[ORCH]</TT>, plum <TT>[PLUM]</TT>, or chrysanthemum <TT>[CHRY]</TT>) matches any other open &quot;<I>flower</I>&quot; tile and any open &quot;<I>season</I>&quot; tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any other open &quot;<I>season</I>&quot; tile. 
<P>Tiles are stacked on the board, the height of the tile is indicated by the color coding as follows:- 
<UL><P><TT>Level&nbsp;5</TT>&nbsp;-&nbsp;White 
<BR><TT>Level&nbsp;4</TT>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Red 
<BR><TT>Level&nbsp;3</TT>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Yellow 
<BR><TT>Level&nbsp;2</TT>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Green 
<BR><TT>Level&nbsp;1</TT>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Cyan 
</UL><P>To remove a pair of tiles, click the left mouse button on a tile (which will show in the selection color) and then click the left mouse button on the matching tile. At this point, both tiles will disappear from the board. If after selecting the first tile, you decide that you don't wish to play that tile, simply reclick the left button on the selected tile, alternatively click the right button to deselect any selected tile. 
<P>To the right of the board are a number of control buttons. To select an option, click the left mouse button on it.
