<UL><P>benchmrk - Benchmark MicroEmacs macro processor speed </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>me</B> &quot;@benchmrk&quot; </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>The start-up file <TT>benchmrk.emf</TT> may be invoked from the command line to time the macro processor variable manipulation times. 
<P>This macro suite was developed to optimize the macro processor performance, and allows comparable analysis of various macro variable manipulations. The macro is not important in it's own right and is not likely to be useful. Running it will provide an in-site into the speed of the macro language and should indicate to the user what are good and bad things to be doing. 
<P>As an aside, as MicroEmacs interprets the macro code the it is important that the processing operates at a reasonable speed. Most extensions offering additional functionality are likely to be added to MicroEmacs by way of a macro implementation - this allows speedy development of new features. Obviously core changes do occur when we find that we cannot support certain new requirements, or when the macro code becomes too convoluted. In these cases, new commands are added to help us solve the problem. However, recent evolution of the code has indicated that the core set is now reasonably complete. </UL>
