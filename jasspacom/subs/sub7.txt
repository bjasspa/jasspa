Title:  Auto-completion macro

If you are writing a document or a program, typically you are writing the same
words again and again. Often if you are a programmer  you have to remember the
name  of a  certain  function  you  just  were  creating.  In my case  most of
compiler-error-messages come from misspelled function or variable names.

To minimise  such trouble you can use the following  autocomplete-word  macro.
Start  writing the word the first two, three, four or five letters and execute
the macro and it will search  backward for these letters,  replacing them with
the first  matching word found. These  letters  should  match the beginning of
the  word exactly.

This is  especially  useful  if you see the other  word  still on the  screen.
Normally you would type the function or macro-name: what-for-a-wonderful-macro
again, or you try to copy and past it, very  borrowing. I simply write "what-"
and press "C-1" and the name is  completed:  what-for-a-wonderful-macro.  This
macro can be also found at: www.microemacs.de/macros.htm

    ; copy clip to variable
    set-variable #l0 @y
    ; how many letters ?
    set-variable #l1 &len #l0
    ; empty clipboard
    -1 yank
    backward-word
    ; search clip and extract rest of the word
    search-backward #l0
