<UL><P>Windows - Where is app850.fon ? </UL>
<H2><B>ANSWER </B></H2>
<UL><P>&quot;app850.fon&quot; is the font file used for the DOS window under '95/'95/NT. You should find it in your c: hidden. If you search from the Explorer-&gt;Tools-&gt;Find &quot;app850.fon&quot; it should be found in the fonts directory. There is nothing to be done - the file exists and is in the correct location. 
<P>If you do not have this file then, you might have &quot;appXXX.fon&quot;, or some other fixed font. You can locate the file that you want as follows:- 
<UL><P>Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Fonts </UL>
<P>Display the font list as 'details'. Within that list you should find a &quot;MS-DOS CPXXX&quot; entry. It will be a red font (if you are in monochrome then it will have a 'A' in the box rather than a 'Tt'). This is a fixed font and will be a good alternative to &quot;app850.fon&quot;, you can also try the &quot;Fixedsys&quot; font file which has some weird name. 
<P>To be honest I do not know what Microsoft are currently shipping. Most of the Windows platforms that I have used have been upgrades or been abused by so many people you never know what is original !! 
<P>We would be interested in any details of other fixed fonts, which support the full OEM character set that are better alternatives to the DOS ones.
