<UL><P>next-window-find-file - Split the current window and find file </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>next-window-find-file</B> &quot;<I>file</I>&quot; (<B>C-x&nbsp;4</B>)&nbsp; </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>next-window-find-file</B> splits the current window into two near equal windows, and loads the given <I>file</I> into the current window. It is effectively a 
<A HREF="m2cmd128.html">split-window-vertically(2)</A> command followed by a 
<A HREF="m2cmd056.html">find-file(2)</A>. 
<P>When there is insufficient space in the current window to perform the split, then the current window is replaced. The requested <I>file</I> is always displayed, if the file does not already exist it is effectively created within MicroEmacs (although it will not exist on the disk until a save operation is performed). 
<P>The numeric argument <I>n</I> can be used to modify the default behaviour of the command, where the bits are defined as follows: 
<P><B>0x01</B> 
<BR><UL>If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails at this point. If the file does not exist and this bit is set (or no argument is specified as the default argument is <TT>1</TT>) then a new empty buffer is created with the given file name, saving the buffer subsequently creates a new file. </UL>
<P><B>0x02</B> 
<BR><UL>If this bit is set the file will be loaded with 
<A HREF="m2mod018.html">binary(2m)</A> mode enabled. See help on <B>binary</B> mode for more information on editing binary data files. </UL>
<P><B>0x04</B> 
<BR><UL>If this bit is set the file will be loaded with 
<A HREF="m2mod003.html">crypt(2m)</A> mode enabled. See help on <B>crypt</B> mode for more information on editing encrypted files. </UL>
<P><B>0x08</B> 
<BR><UL>If this bit is set the file will be loaded with 
<A HREF="m2mod031.html">rbin(2m)</A> mode enabled. See help on <B>rbin</B> mode for more information on efficient editing of binary data files. </UL></UL>
