<H2><B>NAME </B></H2>
<UL><P>file-op - File system operations command </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><I>n</I> <B>file-op</B> [ ( [ &quot;<I>from-file</I>&quot; &quot;<I>to-file</I>&quot; ] ) | 
<BR><UL>( [&quot;<I>delete-file</I>&quot;] ) | ( [&quot;<I>dir-name</I>&quot;] ) ] </UL></UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>file-op</B> can be used to perform numerous file system operations. The given argument <I>n</I> must be used to determine the required operation, the value is a bit based flag denoting the operation as follows: 
<P><B>0x010</B> 
<BR><UL>Log-off and close down the current ftp connect (not a file system operation but functionality was required and it had to go somewhere). </UL>
<P><B>0x020</B> 
<BR><UL>When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to delete-file, the single argument <I>delete-file</I> is deleted. </UL>
<P><B>0x040</B> 
<BR><UL>When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to move-file, the specified <I>from-file</I> is moved to <I>to-file</I>. </UL>
<P><B>0x080</B> 
<BR><UL>When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to copy-file, the specified <I>from-file</I> is copied to <I>to-file</I>. </UL>
<P><B>0x100</B> 
<BR><UL>When this bit is set the command functionality is changed to making a new directory, the specified <I>dir-name</I> is the name of the new directory. A file or directory of the given name must not already exist. 
</UL><P>Only one operation can be performed per invocation. The following bits in the given argument <I>n</I> can be used to effect the behaviour of these operations: 
<P><B>0x01</B> 
<BR><UL>Enables validity checks, these include a check that the proposed file does not already exist, if so confirmation of writing is requested from the user. Also MicroEmacs checks all other current buffers for one with the proposed file name, if found, again confirmation is requested. Without this flag the command will always succeed wherever possible. </UL>
<P><B>0x02</B> 
<BR><UL>Creates a backup of any file about to be deleted or over-written. Set help on 
<A HREF="m5var082.html">$buffer-backup(5)</A> for backup file-name generation. </UL></UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>http</B> files are not supported except as the source file when copying. <B>ftp</B> files are fully supported with the restriction that the from and to files cannot both be url (http or ftp) files. 
<P>The command is used by 
<A HREF="m3mac027.html">file-browser(3)</A> and 
<A HREF="m3mac050.html">ftp(3)</A> which provides an easy to use interfaces for file manipulation. </UL>
