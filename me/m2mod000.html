<H2><B>NAME </B></H2>
<UL><P>auto - Automatic source file line type detection </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>auto Mode</B> 
<P><B>A</B> - mode line letter. </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>When this mode is enabled the line style of the source file, with respect to <TT>CR/LF/CTRL-Z</TT> characters, are automatically detected and the file (if saved) is written out in the same style as it was read in. This mode is designed to solve the problems of MS-DOS which utilize a '<B>\r\n</B>' with every new line and a <B>ctrl-Z</B> as a file terminator, conversely UNIX utilizes only '<B>\n</B>' as a line terminator. 
<P><B>auto</B> mode therefore allows files to be edited across file system types without corrupting the line style of the native platform. 
<P>At load time, if <B>auto</B> detects CR/LF style line feeds then it enables the buffer mode 
<A HREF="m2mod024.html">crlf(2m)</A>, and if a CTRL-Z is found at the end of the file then mode 
<A HREF="m2mod030.html">ctrlz(2m)</A> is enabled. Otherwise these modes are cleared. 
<P>At write time, if <B>auto</B> mode is enabled then the file is written out is a style determined by modes <B>crlf</B> and <B>ctrlz</B>. For example, if crlf was enabled and ctrlz disabled then the file would be written out with new lines as '<B>\r\n</B>' and with no ending ctrl-z. 
<P>If auto is not enabled then the file is written out in the style of the current platform, regardless of the current settings on modes <B>crlf</B> and <B>ctrlz</B>. </UL>
<H2><B>SUMMARY </B></H2>
<UL><P>The operation on the modes may be summarized as follows:- </UL>
<H2>UNIX Systems </H2>
<UL><UL><P>
<LI><B>auto Enabled</B> UNIX and MS-DOS files may be edited normally, edits are saved in the format read by the system. 
<LI><B>auto Disabled</B> UNIX files may be edited normally, files saved as UNIX files. MS-DOS files show a <TT>^M</TT> character at the end of each line (editing is not advised if the purity of the MS-DOS is to be maintained), any edits are written back as displayed on the screen. </UL></UL>
<H2>MS-DOS Systems </H2>
<UL><UL><P>
<LI><B>auto Enabled</B> UNIX and MS-DOS files may be edited normally, edits are saved in the format read by the system. 
<LI><B>auto Disabled</B> on reading all files are read and editing may be undertaken normally. On writing, '<B>\r</B>'s and a <B>ctrl-Z</B> are automatically added. The act of reading a UNIX file and re-writing it translates it to an MS-DOS file. </UL></UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>This mode MUST be enabled globally when the file is loaded for the file style to be correctly detected. 
<P>It is <B>strongly advised</B> that auto mode is permanently enabled. 
<P>Windows systems tend to use a '<B>\r\n</B>' style line feed but with no trailing ctrl-z. </UL>
