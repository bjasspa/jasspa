<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>MicroEmacs may be executed from the command line to invoke the <I>Graphical Difference</I> 
<A HREF="m3mac044.html">gdiff(3)</A> macro, showing the difference(s) between two files. 
<P>The editor is invoked in <B>gdiff</B> mode and shows the difference between the two files on the command line. The two files are presented side by side and the lines are matched together, the windows are effectively locked together, scrolling one window causes the other window to scroll. 
<P>The changes are shown as color coded regions of highlighted text. Each block (or line) has to be accepted or rejected by the user, when all blocks have been accepted then the buffer may be written out merging the changes from both files depending on the accept/reject status. Blocks which have been accepted are typically shown in green, the rejected lines are shown in red. </UL>
