<H2><B>NAME </B></H2>
<UL><P>yank - Paste (copy) kill buffer contents into buffer </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><I>n</I> <B>yank</B> (<B>C-y</B>)&nbsp; </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>When a non negative argument is supplied to <B>yank</B>, the command copies the contents of the kill buffer <I>n</I> times into the current buffer at the current cursor position. This does not clear the kill buffer, and therefore may be used to make multiple copies of a section of text. On windowing systems which support clip-boards, such as windows and X-terms, MicroEmacs will also cut to and paste from the global clip-board. 
<P>If <I>yank</I> is IMMEDIATELY followed by a 
<A HREF="m2cmd111.html">reyank(2)</A> then the <I>yanked</I> text is replaced by text of the next entry in the kill ring. (another <B>reyank</B> replaces the text with the previous reyank text and so on). 
<P>If an -ve argument is given, <B>yank</B> removes the last 0-<I>n</I> items from the kill ring. 
<P>Text is inserted into the kill buffer by one of the following commands:- 
<UL><P>
<A HREF="m2cmd035.html">backward-kill-word(2)</A>, 
<A HREF="m2cmd022.html">copy-region(2)</A>, 
<A HREF="m2cmd035.html">forward-kill-word(2)</A>, 
<A HREF="m2cmd082.html">kill-line(2)</A>, 
<A HREF="m2cmd080.html">kill-paragraph(2)</A>, 
<A HREF="m2cmd081.html">kill-region(2)</A>, 
<A HREF="m2cmd034.html">forward-delete-char(2)</A>, 
<A HREF="m2cmd034.html">backward-delete-char(2)</A>. </UL>
<P>All the above commands (except <B>copy-region</B>) cut text out of the buffer, the last two character delete commands require the presence of a numeric argument to add the deleted text to the kill buffer. If any of these commands are executed immediately after any other (including itself) or the 
<A HREF="m4fil017.html">@cl(4)</A> variable is set to one of these command, the new kill text is appended to the last kill buffer text. </UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>Windowing systems such as X-Windows and Microsoft Windows utilize a global windowing kill buffer allowing data to be moved between windowing applications (<I>cut buffer</I> and <I>clipboard</I>, respectively). Within these environments MicroEmacs '05 automatically interacts with the windowing systems kill buffer, the last MicroEmacs '05 kill buffer entry is immediately available for a <I>paste</I> operation into another application (regardless of how it was inserted into the kill buffer). Conversely, data placed in the windowing kill buffer is available to MicroEmacs '05, via <B>yank</B>, until a new item has been inserted into the kill buffer (the data may still be available via 
<A HREF="m2cmd111.html">reyank(2)</A>). </UL>
<H2><B>EXAMPLE </B></H2>
<UL><P>The following example is a basic macro code implementation of the 
<A HREF="m2cmd135.html">transpose-lines(2)</A> command, <UL>
<PRE>beginning-of-line 
kill-line 
forward-line 
yank 
-1&nbsp;yank 
backward-line 
</PRE></UL>
<P>Note that similar to <B>transpose-lines</B> it does not leave the moved line in the kill buffer, effectively tidying up after itself. </UL>
