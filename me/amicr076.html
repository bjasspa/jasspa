<UL><P>File Types; how do I interchange between UNIX, Windows and DOS files ?? </UL>
<H2><B>ANSWER </B></H2>
<UL><P>MicroEmacs '06 facilitates the editing of the standard file types on all platforms. All files retain their line ending type through edits. i.e. if a DOS file is edited on a UNIX system, the file is still written as a DOS file. When new files are created, they are created with the standard attributes of the host O/S. 
<P>The line ending of the file may be modified from the menu 
<UL><P><B>file</B> -&gt; <B>attributes</B> </UL>
<P>This brings up a dialog that allows the file type and attributes to be modified. 
<P>Note that the only ending that is NOT preserved are files whose lines end in <TT>&lt;CR&gt;</TT>'s only. The line format is correctly interpreted on reading, but is not retained on the write.
