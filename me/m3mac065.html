<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>The <B>page-file</B> commands allow large files, up to 2GB in size, to be viewed and edited. <B>page-file</B> operates by loading a small part (or <I>page</I>) of the file into a buffer for viewing and editing hence the whole file is not loaded into memory. The file may be viewed and edited while in a page mode, MicroEmacs automatically manages the page swapping and updates to the file. 
<P>While a file is being paged then a replacement set of commands are used to navigate through the buffer. These replacement commands automatically load the next page into the buffer, discarding or saving any edits from existing pages. </UL>
<H2>File Loading </H2>
<UL><P><B>page-file</B> finds the named file <I>file-name</I>. If it is already in a buffer, make that buffer active in the current window, otherwise attempt to create a new paged buffer and read the file into it. Syntax hilighting is available following any file loading. <B>page-file</B> is the paged equivalent of 
<A HREF="m2cmd056.html">find-file(2)</A>. 
<P>The numeric argument <I>n</I> is used to modify the default behavior of the command, where the bits are defined as follows: 
<P><B>0x01</B> 
<BR><UL>If the file does not exist and this bit is not set the command fails at this point. </UL>
<P><B>0x02</B> 
<BR><UL>If this bit is set the file will be loaded with 
<A HREF="m2mod018.html">binary(2m)</A> mode enabled. See help on <B>binary</B> mode for more information on editing binary data files. 
</UL><P><B>page-bfile</B> loads a file as binary data, providing binary editing capabilities. The command operate as command 
<A HREF="m3mac065.html">page-file(3)</A> except that it loads the given file with 
<A HREF="m2mod018.html">binary(2m)</A> mode set. </UL>
<H2>Saving </H2>
<UL><P><B>page-file-save-buffer</B> saves the contents of the current buffer if the contents have been changed, writing the buffer back to the file it was read from. This command is the same as 
<A HREF="m2cmd113.html">save-buffer(2)</A> for a paged file. </UL>
<H2>Navigation </H2>
<UL><P><B>page-file-beginning-of-buffer</B> moves to the beginning of the buffer. If any edits have been performed at the current viewing position that need to be saved then the user is prompted to save the changes and the new pages are loaded from the file at the beginning of the buffer. 
<P><B>page-file-end-of-buffer</B> moves to the end of the buffer in a similar way to <B>page-file-beginning-of-buffer</B>. 
<P><B>page-file-goto-byte</B> advances the buffer to the byte offset specified by <I>byte-offset</I>. If any edits have been performed at the current viewing position that need to be saved then the user is prompted to save the changes and the new pages are loaded from the file at the specified file byte offset. 
<P><B>page-file-goto-page</B> advances the buffer to the page offset specified by <I>byte-offset</I>. The behavior is the same as <B>page-file-goto-byte</B>. 
<P><B>page-file-scroll-up</B> and <B>page-file-scroll-down</B> moves the window in the current buffer down by <I>n</I> lines, the default when <I>n</I> is omitted is 1 windows worth of lines i.e. a next page operation. The user is prompted to save changes if a file paging operation is performed. 
<P><B>page-file-forward-line</B> moves the cursor down <I>n</I> lines, default 1. If the line is not on the current screen then display the next page and move to the line. Similarly <B>page-file-backward-line</B> moves the cursor up <I>n</I> lines, if the line is not on the current screen then display the previous page and move to the line. The user is prompted to save changes if a file paging operation is performed. </UL>
<H2>Searching </H2>
<UL><P><B>page-file-search-forward</B> and <B>page-file-search-backward</B> searches for a string from the current cursor position to the end/start of the file and is simular to 
<A HREF="m2cmd116.html">search-forward(2)</A> and 
<A HREF="m2cmd116.html">search-backward(2)</A>, respectively. If the search string is not found in the current buffer then the search continues by paging the file until the start/end of the file is reached. The user is prompted to save changes if a file paging operation is performed. 
<P><B>page-file-isearch-forward</B> and <B>page-file-isearch-backward</B> perform and incremental forward and backward search in the paged file and are similar to 
<A HREF="m2cmd078.html">isearch-forward(2)</A> and 
<A HREF="m2cmd078.html">isearch-backward(2)</A>, respectively. If the search string is not found in the current buffer then the search continues by paging the file until the start/end of the file is reached. The user is prompted to page and save changes if a file paging operation is performed. </UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>The <B>page-file</B> macros are implemented in macro file <TT>pagefile.emf</TT>. The paging is managed in macro space and uses 
<A HREF="m2cmd073.html">insert-file(2)</A> to perform the read. </UL>
