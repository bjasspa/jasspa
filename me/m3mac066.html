<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P>The toolbar is one or more fixed buffers that typically appear at the left-hand edge of the window that contains different tools that assist in editing the buffer. The toolbar is really a container for tools and short cuts which are configured by the user depending on the tool that has been loaded. The tools themselves are buffer context sensitive, the 
<A HREF="m3mac064.html">buffer-init(3)</A> command automatically re-configures the toolbar for the buffer at run time. 
<P>The configuration of the toolbar is stored in command variables <TT>.toolvar.*</TT> which are used to control the toolbar. The tools that are available in toolbar are determined from the file <TT>toollist.emf</TT> which is loaded when the toolbar is started. User defined toolbars may be added by redefinging the toolbar variables at runtime. 
<P><B>toolbar</B> toggles the visibility of the toolbar, i.e. if the toolbar is open it is closed and vica versa. If the numeric argument <I>n</I> is specified then zero closes the toolbar and non-zero opens the toolbar. <B>toolbar-open</B> initializes and starts the toolbar if it is not already running. The toolbar is loaded and instantiated in the system. The toolbar may be subsequently closed using <B>toolbar-close</B>. Whilst the toolbar is running then the content of the tollbar may become out of date, the command 
<A HREF="m3mac066.html">toolbar-refresh(3)</A> forces the toolbar to be re-evaluated and the content is updated. </UL>
<H2><B>CONFIGURATION </B></H2>
<UL><P>The toolbar is configured with command variables <B>.toolbar.*</B>. The size information of the toolbar is defined with the following variables:- 
<P><I>.toolbar.width</I> 
<BR><UL>Defines the default width of the left-hand vertical toolbar. </UL>
<P><I>.toolbar.depth</I> 
<BR><UL>Defines the default depth of the top horizontal toolbar. </UL>
<P>The tools within the toolbar are configured with the following variables. Each variable is divided into fields, each field represents a single tool. The fields are separated with the <TT>\CH</TT> character. The order of the fields MUST be the same in each of the variables such that the field content matches the tool that is being defined. 
<P><I>.tool-flag</I> 
<BR><UL>The <B>.tool-flag</B> variable describes the behaviour of the tool, this is defined as a bitmask as follows:- 
<P><TT>0x000001</TT> - Update on creation 
<BR><UL>Call the tool update command when the tool is created, this is typically required when the content of the toolbar is generated. </UL>
<P><TT>0x000002</TT> - Update on redraw 
<BR><UL>Call the tool update command when a 
<A HREF="m2cmd108.html">redraw</A> operation has been performed. </UL>
<P><TT>0x000004</TT> - Buffer type changed 
<BR><UL>Call the tool update command when the buffer type has changed, a change of buffer type requires that a buffer specific tool is reconfigured. </UL>
<P><TT>0x000008</TT> - Current buffer changed 
<BR><UL>Call the tool update command when the current buffer is changed, a change of buffer buffer requires that a buffer content specific tool is reconfigured. </UL>
<P><TT>0x000010</TT> - Current buffer modified or saved 
<BR><UL>Call the tool update command when the current buffer is modified or saved. </UL>
<P><TT>0x000080</TT> - Perform update checks 
<BR><UL>On an update check the toolbar for changes in content. </UL>
<P><TT>0x000100</TT> - Lock depth and width 
<BR><UL>Lock the depth and width of the tool. </UL>
<P><TT>0x000200</TT> - Tool uses a paged window 
<BR><UL>The tool uses a paged window in the toolbar (i.e. only one tool has focus). </UL>
<P><TT>0x000400</TT> - Tool is hidden 
<BR><UL>The tool is currently hidden. When in this state the not active sub-page <TT>0x200</TT> will also be set. </UL>
<P><TT>0x000800</TT> - Tool paged window, not first user. 
<BR><UL>The tool is part of a paged window and is not the first tool. </UL>
<P><TT>0x001000</TT> - position in the left toolbar

<P><TT>0x008000</TT> - position in the bottom toolbar 
<BR><UL>The tool is present in the bottom toolbar, on toolbar creation the tool is automatically loaded into the toolbar. </UL>
<P><TT>0x010000</TT> - Include buffer type in mode-line (Prefix) 
<BR><UL>The buffer type is included in the toolbar mode line as a prefix. </UL>
<P><TT>0x020000</TT> - Include buffer name in mode-line (suffix)

<P><TT>0x100000</TT> - Restore window location after an update 
<BR><UL>The position of the hilighted line in the toolbar is restored after an update. </UL>
<P><TT>0x200000</TT> - Move position to beginning of buffer after an update 
<BR><UL>The position of the hilighted line is restored to the top of the buffer following an update. </UL></UL>

<BR><UL>A short description of the tool which is used in the tool selection dialog. </UL>
<P><I>.toolbar.tool-buffs</I>
