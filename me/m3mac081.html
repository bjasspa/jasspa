<H2><B>NAME </B></H2>
<UL><P>read-session - Read in session information </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><I>n</I> <B>read-session</B> [ &quot;<I>session-file</I>&quot; ] </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>read-session</B> reads in a MicroEmacs '06 session file, setting the current session information. If argument <B>n</B> is not given then the given &quot;<I>session-file</I>&quot; is simply read in. If a non-zero argument is specified then default session is set to the given file-name and the file is read. If an argument of zero is given then the default session is re-read. Information read in (and saved) from the history file includes:- <UL><P>
<LI>Searching and replacing history. 
<LI>Buffer name history. 
<LI>Command name history. 
<LI>File name history. 
<LI>General (all the rest) history. 
<LI>Buffer and file list with line numbers. </UL><P>MicroEmacs '06's environment may be retained almost intact by the use of the default session and using the <B>-c</B> (continue) command-line option to re-load all files that were being edited in a previous session. 
<P>On loading a new session then the user is prompted to save the current session. If the numeric argument is zero (bit 0 is 0) then the user is not prompted and the <I>session-file</I> is effectively loaded and merged into the current session. </UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>When running multiple MicroEmacs '06 sessions on the same work-station (or different workstations sharing the same home directory), the default history is saved when MicroEmacs '06 exits. As a result the last MicroEmacs '06 sessions that terminates writes the history information used next time. 
<P>The session information is saved in a registry format file (see 
<A HREF="m8fil008.html">esf(8)</A>). Reference should be made to the notes included in 
<A HREF="m8fil004.html">erf(8)</A> as to how the history file may be edited and effected in the same MicroEmacs '06 session. 
<P>The user may now have multiple sessions, this is useful when one is working on different projects, the sessions are created using 
<A HREF="m3mac080.html">save-session(3)</A> using a new session name. Starting the editor with a different session means that the hilighting scheme may be different between different sessions i.e. &quot;<I>Blue</I> <I>Hue</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Sherwoord</I> <I>Forest</I>&quot;. Note that the color scheme should be changed with 
<A HREF="m3mac084.html">change-scheme(3)</A> and not with 
<A HREF="m3osd000.html">user-setup(3)</A> if different sessions are to use different color schemes. </UL>
<H2>Command Line </H2>
<UL><P>Reading a session is generally performed when a MicroEmacs session is started using the &quot;<B>-c</B>&quot; command line option rather than from the emacs mode line or main menu, see 
<A HREF="m1cmd000.html">me(1)</A>. Invoking 
<UL><P><B>me -c</B><I>&lt;mySessionName&gt;</I> </UL>
<P>where <I>&lt;mySessionName&gt;</I> is the name of the session (the 
<A HREF="m5var076.html">$MENAME(5)</A> or system login name) will restore all of of the buffers, windows layout, point and mark positions, main window size etc. at the point of the last shut down. e.g. given a system login name of <I>jasspa</I> then 
<UL><P><B>me -c</B><I>jasspa</I> </UL>
<P>restores the session to the state when <I>jasspa</I> last exited MicroEmacs. When the session name is specified then no other files should be specified, so the command line 
<UL><P><B>me -c</B><I>jasspa</I> <TT>morefiles.txt</TT> </UL>
<P>restores the buffers but does not restore the window layout because this has been destroyed by the introduction of the new file &quot;<TT>morefiles.txt</TT>&quot;. This type of command with another file behaves as the old &quot;<TT>me -c</TT>&quot; command prior to the 2006 release that did not support sessions. If <I>&lt;mySessionName&gt;</I> is not specified then the buffers are restored but the window layout is not restored. </UL>
