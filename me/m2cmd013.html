<UL><P>global-bind-key - Bind a key to a named command or macro 
<BR>global-unbind-key - &quot;Unbind a key from a named command or macro&quot; </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><I>n</I> <B>global-bind-key</B> &quot;<I>command</I>&quot; &quot;<I>key</I>&quot; (<B>esc k</B>)&nbsp; 
<BR><I>n</I> <B>global-unbind-key</B> &quot;<I>key</I>&quot; (<B>esc C-k</B>)&nbsp; </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>global-bind-key</B> takes one of the named commands and binds it to a key. Thereafter, whenever that key is struck, the bound command is executed. If an argument <I>n</I> is given then the bound command is executed <I>n</I> times when the key is struck. (i.e. the command is passed the numeric argument '<I>n</I>'). 
<P><B>global-unbind-key</B> unbinds (detaches) a user entered <I>key</I> sequence (i.e. <TT>C-x&nbsp;C-f</TT>) from any command to which it may be bound. This does not work with 
<A HREF="m2cmd084.html">buffer</A> or 
<A HREF="m2cmd085.html">message line</A> key bindings, see 
<A HREF="m2cmd084.html">buffer-unbind-key(2)</A> and 
<A HREF="m2cmd085.html">ml-unbind-key(2)</A>. If an argument of 0 is given to <B>global-unbind-key</B>, only a single key is obtained for the user, if the character is currently bound to the 
<A HREF="m2cmd028.html">prefix</A> command, the prefix binding and any sub-bindings are removed. <B>global-bind-key</B> calls <B>global-unbind-key</B> first if the key to be bound is already bound to something else. 
<P>If a -ve argument is given to <B>global-unbind-key</B> then all bindings are removed, <B>caution</B> - removing all bindings interactively will render the current MicroEmacs session unusable. This can only be used within macro development where new bindings are created immediately afterwards. 
<P>The <B>global-bind-key</B> command, currently bound to <TT>esc k</TT>, prompts the user for the named command and the key to which it is to be bound. This help file gives a complete list of all built in commands, and some useful macros, a complete list of all commands and macros can be obtained by using the command completion (type <TT>esc x</TT>&nbsp;<TT>tab</TT>&nbsp;<TT>tab</TT>, see 
<A HREF="m2cmd085.html">ml-bind-key(2)</A>) or using the command 
<A HREF="m2cmd038.html">describe-bindings(2)</A>. 
<P>The mouse buttons are considered to be <I>keys</I>, there is a <I>key</I> for each button press and release event, use 
<A HREF="m2cmd039.html">describe-key(2)</A> to get the binding key string. 
<P>The non-ASCII standard keys such as the cursor keys have 'standard' key names to make cross platform binding support easy. Some systems such as <I>termcap</I> do not have fixed key-bindings, for these key the users must use the command 
<A HREF="m2cmd133.html">translate-key(2)</A> to convert the system key binding to the standard key binding. 
<P>Permanent changes are done indirectly through the <TT>me.emf</TT> file. This is a file that MicroEmacs '02 reads and executes (see 
<A HREF="m2cmd045.html">execute-file(2)</A>) during startup and hence results in the appearance of a permanent change in the key bindings. The syntax of commands in the <TT>me.emf</TT> file is described under the 
<A HREF="m2cmd045.html">execute-file</A> command. Of principal concern here are the two commands <B>global-bind-key</B> and <B>global-unbind-key</B>. The primary difference between the way parameters are passed to these commands in the <TT>me.emf</TT> file is that the keys are not typed in directly (as in the <I>control-I</I> key when you want <TT>C-i</TT>) but by symbolic names. Every key has a unique name which can be easily obtained with the current binding by using the command 
<A HREF="m2cmd039.html">describe-key(2)</A>. 
<P>See help on 
<A HREF="m2cmd203.html">Key Names</A> for a description of the symbolic naming system and a complete list of valid key names. Also see 
<A HREF="m2cmd200.html">Bindings</A> for a complete list of default key bindings. </UL>

<UL><P>Note that binding <B>Control-Alt-Delete</B> is not recommended for MS-DOS systems for obvious reasons. </UL></UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>Some ASCII keys, such as <TT>&lt;CR&gt;</TT> (C-m), <TT>&lt;tab&gt;</TT> (C-i), <TT>&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;</TT> (C-h) have non-ASCII key bindings, namely &quot;<B>return</B>&quot;, &quot;<B>tab</B>&quot;, &quot;<B>backspace</B>&quot; etc. this is to allow separate key-bindings for the real &quot;<B>C-m</B>&quot; etc. 
<P>Be very careful in binding and unbinding keys since you could get into some very peculiar situations such as being unable to abort out of a command (if you unbind CTRL-G or bind it to something else) or recover from the bad binding/unbinding if you unbind 
<A HREF="m2cmd047.html">execute-named-command(2)</A> or the <B>global-unbind-key</B> command. As long as you leave yourself the opportunity to do both of the last two commands, you can recover from disastrous bindings/unbindings. </UL>
