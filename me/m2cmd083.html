<UL><P>list-buffers - List all buffers and show their status </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>list-buffers</B> (<B>C-x&nbsp;C-b</B>)&nbsp; </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>list-buffers</B> splits the current window and in one half brings up a list of all the buffers currently existing in the editor. The active modes, change flag, and active flag for each buffer is displayed. (The change flag is a <B>*</B> character if the buffer has been changed and not written out. The active flag is not an <B>@</B> if the file had been specified on the command line, but has not been read in yet since nothing has switched to that buffer.) 
<P>The buffer list has some special command keys associated with it which allow the state of the buffers to be edited from the buffer list, the editing allows buffers to be killed and saved to disk. The key codes are defined as follows:- 
<P><B>1</B> - Switch to buffer 
<BR><UL>Switch to that buffer and make it the only buffer. </UL>
<P><B>2</B> - Move to buffer 
<BR><UL>Switch the buffer list window to that buffer. </UL>
<P><B>D</B> - delete buffer 
<BR><UL>Flag buffer for deletion. A buffer scheduled for deletion is marked with a '<B>D</B>' in first column. The delete status is enacted by the '<B>X</B>' command, or may be removed with the '<B>U</B>' command. </UL>
<P><B>S</B> - save buffer 
<BR><UL>Flag buffer for saving. A buffer scheduled from saving is marked with a '<B>S</B>' in the second column. Note that a buffer may be marked for saving and deletion, the save operation is performed before the delete. </UL>
<P><B>U</B> - unmark buffer 
<BR><UL>Unmark the '<B>D</B>' and '<B>S</B>' flags on current line. </UL>
<P><B>X</B> - execute 
<BR><UL>Execute all the '<B>D</B>' and '<B>S</B>' flags currently set. The <B>S</B>ave is enacted first. </UL>
<P>For all but '<B>X</B>', the buffer selected is the buffer noted on the current cursor line. These keys are not remappable. </UL>
