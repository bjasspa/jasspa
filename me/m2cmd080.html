<UL><P>kill-paragraph - Delete a paragraph </UL>
<H2><B>SYNOPSIS </B></H2>
<UL><P><I>n</I> <B>kill-paragraph</B> </UL>
<H2><B>DESCRIPTION </B></H2>
<UL><P><B>kill-paragraph</B> deletes the next <I>n</I> paragraphs, if <I>n</I> is +ve then the paragraph the cursor is currently in and the next <I>n</I>-1 paragraphs are killed. If <I>n</I> is -ve then the current paragraph and the previous <I>n</I>-1 paragraphs are killed. If <I>n</I> is zero the command simply returns. The default value for <I>n</I> is 1. </UL>
<H2><B>DIAGNOSTICS </B></H2>
<UL><P>The following errors can be generated, in each case the command returns a FALSE status: 
<P><B>[end of buffer]</B> 
<BR><UL>The given argument <I>n</I> was greater that the number of remaining paragraphs, all the remaining paragraphs are still removed. </UL>
<P><B>[top of buffer]</B> 
<BR><UL>A negative argument <I>n</I> was given requesting more paragraphs to be killed then are present before the cursor. All the paragraphs before the cursor are still removed. </UL></UL>
<H2><B>NOTES </B></H2>
<UL><P>A paragraph is terminated by a blank line. All text residing between two blank lines is considered to be a paragraph - regardless of the text layout. 
<P>The distinction between killed text and deleted text is that text which is killed is placed into the yank buffer so that it can be pasted into any buffer using 
<A HREF="m2cmd146.html">yank(2)</A>. </UL>
