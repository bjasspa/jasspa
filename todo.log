    [040206] SP/RC4 - Critical - To be fixed next release

        On unix the $progname may not be fully  expanded (has just "me") which
        may  lead  to a  ctags  generation  error  and  an  alternate  fix  to
        $search-path.

    [040206] SP/RC4 - Major - To be fixed next release

        On unix,  find-file  of a symbolic  link which  points to a  directory
        results  in a bad dir  listing.  The list of files is correct  but the
        stats are all wrong (found on sunos 5.8).

    [040206] Th/RC4 - Minor - To be fixed next release

        Document the create/delete/next-frame keys.

    [040206] JG/RC4 - Critical - To be fixed next release

        UNIX the Copy and Paste is not  working  correctly  between  X-Windows
        applications.  Data selected in Mozilla  copies into GNU Emacs OK, but
        not into ME.
        
        Fixed 04/02/09: Build Solaris 8 image.

    [040206] JG/RC4 - Minor - To be fixed next release

        -n command line option to a console build causes a option  failure and
        the executable does not run.

    [040206] SP/RC4 - Major - Ideally fixed next release.

        Fix  subtle  ftp bug with  alias  ftp  addressed.  Create  an ftp site
        "ftp://test/"  say with user name foo and  passwd bar and then load in
        "ftp://test/dir1/"   the  buffer  file  name  is   correctly   set  as
        "ftp://test/dir1/"  but the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line is set to
        "ftp://foo@test/dir1/".  Firstly  the  user  may  wish the 'foo' to be
        hidden but secondly  with the  introduction  of being able to click on
        the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line  this  has  introduced  a  subtle
        inefficiency/bug,   if  I  click  on  the   'foo@test'  ME  will  load
        "ftp://foo@test/"  not  "ftp://test/"  which  to  ME  is a  completely
        different file. This can in turn lead to "ftp://foo@test/dir1/"  being
        loaded so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being  loaded! The
        fix is to make  the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line  the  same,  i.e.
        "ftp://test/dir1/"

    [040206] SP/RC4 - Minor - ?
    
        ME  does  not  work  on a  HP-UX  console  .Probably  because  termcap
        database is not being used and built in definitions are being used to 
        over-ride termcap. Need to revisit this.

    [040206] JG/RC4 - Minor - ?

        CVS fails to show sometimes. Typically when done FTP (sunos).

    [040206] JG/RC4 - Minor - ?

        CVS  directory  listing  looses  files  sometimes.  Deleted  files and
        sometimes new files fail to show in CVS directory  listing.  Unsure if
        it is CVS problem or ME problem. (sunos).

    [040206] SP/RC4 - Enhancement

        Would like a Select All and  Inverse  Selection  in the *files*  right
        mouse button menu to select all files/dirs in the listing

        Add new narrow-search-forward and narrow-search-backward commands.

    [040206] JG/RC4 - Enhancement

        CVS has option not to open the dir-tree window, pain in butt.

    [040206] JG/RC4 - Enhancement

        Support to recognize GNU tags for makefile "-*- Makefile -*-" and UNIX
        shell files "-*- sh -*-".

    [040206] JG/RC4 - Enhancement

        Tags window in the tool-bar

    [040206] Th/RC4 - Enhancement

        Support for multiple  pre-configured  print-layouts without setting up
        the printer.

    [010101] ??/RC4 - Enhancement

        Native printer support for generation of postscript.

    [010101] ??/RC4 - Enhancement

        GNU Emacs compatibility macro file (Key bindings).
