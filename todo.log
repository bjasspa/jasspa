        There are  several  differences  between  running  'cvs' and using the
        'cvs-*'  commands  that can lead to  unexpected  and unwanted  results
        (e.g. use C-f10, select a couple of files and then execute cvs-commit,
        this will commit  changes to all files as it does not respect the list
        of selected  files). Also the use of a  *cvs-console*  or *cvs-commit*
        buffer. Should these differences be engineered out?

        Toolbar Directory File List does not contain "../" - UNIX only. 

        Fixed 0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

    [040210] SP/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD
    
        Add support for deleting  directories to file-op and to  file-browser.
        This would also be used by upload's clean process.

        On unix the $progname may not be fully  expanded (has just "me") which
        may  lead  to a  ctags  generation  error  and  an  alternate  fix  to
        $search-path.

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5

        On unix,  find-file  of a symbolic  link which  points to a  directory
        results  in a bad dir  listing.  The list of files is correct  but the
        stats are all wrong (found on sunos 5.8).

        Fixed 0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

    [040206] Th/0401-4 - Minor - Target 0401-5

        Document the create/delete/next-frame keys.

        UNIX the Copy and Paste is not  working  correctly  between  X-Windows
        applications.  Data selected in Mozilla  copies into GNU Emacs OK, but
        not into ME.
        
        Fixed 0401-5 04/02/09: Build Solaris 8 image.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Minor - Target 0401-5

        -n command line option to a console build causes a option  failure and
        the executable does not run.

        Fixed 0401-5 04/02/08: Source change.

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5

        Fix  subtle  ftp bug with  alias  ftp  addressed.  Create  an ftp site
        "ftp://test/"  say with user name foo and  passwd bar and then load in
        "ftp://test/dir1/"   the  buffer  file  name  is   correctly   set  as
        "ftp://test/dir1/"  but the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line is set to
        "ftp://foo@test/dir1/".  Firstly  the  user  may  wish the 'foo' to be
        hidden but secondly  with the  introduction  of being able to click on
        the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line  this  has  introduced  a  subtle
        inefficiency/bug,   if  I  click  on  the   'foo@test'  ME  will  load
        "ftp://foo@test/"  not  "ftp://test/"  which  to  ME  is a  completely
        different file. This can in turn lead to "ftp://foo@test/dir1/"  being
        loaded so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being  loaded! The
        fix is to make  the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line  the  same,  i.e.
        "ftp://test/dir1/"

        Fixed 0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

        ME  does  not  work  on a  HP-UX  console  .Probably  because  termcap
        database is not being used and built in definitions are being used to 
        over-ride termcap. Need to revisit this.

        CVS fails to show sometimes. Typically when done FTP (sunos).

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Minor - Target TBD

        CVS  directory  listing  looses  files  sometimes.  Deleted  files and
        sometimes new files fail to show in CVS directory  listing.  Unsure if
        it is CVS problem or ME problem. (sunos).
