.SH DESCRIPTION
The  \fIInformation  Database  Compiler\fR  file format is an ASCII based file
format designed for the rapid entry of text from mail messages for use with
.Ht idc 1 .
Input to the  compiler  is line based and is divided  into  sections  as shown
above.  Typically the input data spans  multiple  files, a single file is used
for each section. The sections may appear in any order, with the  exception of
the
.Hl "Global Definitions" idcGlobal 4
which MUST be presented to
.Ht idc 1
before any of the other sections. This is necessary as the
.I "Global Definitions"
include short-hand name alias definitions used by the other sections.
.SS "General Syntax"
The file format  utilises  keywords  that must appear in the left hand margin,
utilising the format:-
.IP
\fI<Key Word>\fB:\fR \fI<Text>\fR
.LP
The
.I "<Key\ Word>"
is one of the reserved  words  specified in the sections  below  followed by a
colon (\fC:\fR). There may be no intervening space between the end of the
.I "<Key\ Word>"
and the colon.
.IR "<Key\ Word>" 's
are  case-insensitive  and  may  include  an  intervening  white  space  (e.g.
\fC<space>\fR),  however  the command  translation  performs a literal  string
comparison  so the white  space  must  match.  The  following  are  recognised
commands, with and without white space:-
.IP
.C "Name:"
.br
.C "Date:"
.br
.C "Bug No:"
.br
.C "Suspend Date:"
.LP
The  \fI<Text>\fR may appear on the same or next line(s). The end of the entry
is  delimited by the next  keyword, the end of files are  therefore  typically
delimited by an \fBEnd:\fR marker which terminates the previous field. e.g.
.IP
.B "Bug No:"
852

.br
.B End:
.LP
The
.I "<Key\ Word>"
determines  the  format of the  \fI<Text>\fR  entry. A number of  \fI<Text>\fR
entries are denoted as
.Hl "Formatted Text Description" idcFormat 4
fields.  These  entries  allow  paragraphs  of text  which  may be  formatted.
Individual paragraphs are delimited by a blank line(s).  Special
.I "<Key\ Words>"
are used to apply limited set of
.Hl "formatting" idcFormat 4
characteristics to the generated pages.
.PP
The \fI<Text>\fR entries are free format and do not honour white space (except
for preformatted \fBcode:\fR blocks). White space appearing in the input
is generally used for input file  formatting and will not affect the resultant
output.  The  \fI<Text>\fR  entries  typically  commence  in column 4, so that
their  content  is not  interpreted  as a  command.  The  \fI<Text>\fR  may be
defined in the first  column, but ensure  that there are no colons  within the
line  otherwise they may be interpreted as
.IR "<key\ Word>" 's.
When a white  space  character  appears at the start of the line then the line
is assumed to be a  \fI<Text>\fR  line and the command  parser does not search
for a keyword.
.PP
Comments  may be  included  in the files,  typically  used for headers and for
breaking  up  entries  on the page. A comment may only be defined on a line of
it's own, it may not appear on the end of a \fI<Text>\fR or
.I "<Key\ Word>"
line. The comment exists to the end of the line. Comment keywords are:-
.IP
\fB#:\fR \fIComment to end of line.\fR
.br
\fBRem:\fR \fIComment to end of line.\fR
.br
\fBComment:\fR \fIComment to end of line.\fR
.SS "Sections"
The input to
.Ht idc 1
is  typically  presented  in  sections,  one (or more) files are used for each
section and are presented to the converter in the desired  order. The sections
are defined as:
.TP
.Hl "<Global Definitions>" idcGlobal 4
.\"
Definition of names and module components which may appear in reports. The
.B "Global Definitions"
MUST be the first type of entry presented to the converter.
.TP
.Hl "<Release Definitions>" idcREL 4
.\"
Describes  the releases of software that have been made. These may be internal
development releases in addition to external product releases.
.TP
.Hl "<Information Definitions>" idcINF 4
.\"
Provides general information, e.g. working practices, contact information etc.
.TP
.Hl "<Technical Notes Definitions>" idcTEK 4
.\"

.TP
.Hl "<Frequently Asked Questions>" idcFAQ 4
.\"
Questions  and  answers  posed  both internally and by customers
about any aspect of the system.
.TP
.Hl "<Patch Report Definitions>" idcPAT 4
.\"

The global  definitions  define the  context  for the other  pages in terms of
modules and engineer names. The definitions are defined as follows:
.IP "\fBName:\fR \fI<name>\fR\fC[\fR|\fI<alias>\fC]*\fR"
Defines the name of a person  entitled to submit a report  into the bug system.
One  \fBName:\fR  entry is made  for each  individual.  The  keyword  supports
multiple  alias's,  each alias is separated by a vertical bar  (\fC|\fR).  The
first  name  appearing  in the  list is the  displayed  name in the  generated
reports,  the  alias'es  are  usually  initials  or pseudo  names  used by the
individuals making reports.
.IP
The name field,  combined  with the alias  definitions  enable  reports to be
submitted  with  initials,  speeding up data entry, these are then expanded to
the full name.
.RS
.PP
Consider the following example:
.CS
Name: Arnold Schwartzeneggar|AS|Arnie
Name: William Shakespear|Wil|WS|Shakey
.CE
Any subsequent  \fBName:\fR reference may use any of the defined name aliases.
.RE
.IP "\fBDefModule:\fR \fI<name>\fR\fC[\fR|\fI<alias>\fC]*\fR"
Defines the name of a component in the system, as with the  \fBName:\fR  field,
the first field  identifies  the module name that is displayed, the subsequent
aliases are used for short-hand data entry.
.IP \fBEnd:\fR
Denotes the end of the definitions section.
.NH idcREL 4 "idc(4) - Release Definitions"
.SH "RELEASE DEFINITIONS"
The release  section  (\fBrel\fR)  lists the releases of the product that have
been made,  either  internally  or  externally.  The  release is named and the
\fIname\fR  of the release may be  referenced  by other fields, which  enables
checking to be performed on the date of report submission etc.
.PP
The release reports that are generated show the status of all of the bugs in a
release.

.PP
The fields are defined as follows:
.IP "\fBRelease No:\fR \fI<identity>\fR"
A unique number assigned to the report. Starting from 1 and incremented on
each report.  The identity  is only  used so  that the  page can  be cross
referenced from \fBSee Also:\fR fields. An example is:-
.LP
.RS
.CS 0
Release No:    1
.CE 0
.RE
.IP "\fBDate:\fR \fI<Date>\fR"
The date of the release,  specified  in the form  \fCdd/mm/yy\fR.  This is the
date that the release was made. For a release assigned a \fBState:  patched\fR
the date is specified as \fC'*'\fR, which means the current date.
.IP "\fBName:\fR \fI<name>\fR\fC[\fR|\fI<alias>\fC]*\fR"
Defines the name of the release; the keyword supports  multiple  alias's, each
alias is separated by a vertical bar  (\fC|\fR).  The first name  appearing in
the list is the  displayed  name in the  generated  reports,  the  aliases are
usually  short pseudo names for the release, and may be used when  referencing
the release.
.IP
The name  field,  combined  with the alias  definitions  enable  reports to be
submitted with the aliases, speeding up data entry, these are then expanded to
the full name when referenced.
.RS
.PP
Consider the following example:
.CS
Name: Widget Product Release V1.0|P1|Widget1|Prod1|Rel-1
.CE
Any subsequent  \fBName:\fR reference may use any of the defined name aliases.
The release name may be used in the
.Hh "Bugs Section" idcBUG 4
\fBFix Date:\fR field instead of a date, identifying a bug as being fixed in a
specified release.
.RE
.IP "\fBState:\fR \fC[\fRfull\fC|\fRspecified\fC|\fRpatched\fC]\fR"
The  \fBState:\fR  field  indicates  the status of a release,  there are three
different  states as follows which  determine when bugs are closed down and no
longer appear in releases:
.RS
.IP \fBfull\fR
Indicates a full  release of the product. The release  report lists all of the
bugs that are open  through  the  release  as well as those bugs  closed by the
release.  Bugs closed by a full  release do not appear in  subsequent  release
reports. The bugs that are closed are assumed to be all of those bugs whose
\fBFix  Date:\fR is less than the release  date; or whose  \fBFix  Date:\fR is
explicitly specified as the release name.
.IP \fBspecified\fR
A  specified  release  represents  a  release  of a  product,  it is  subtlely
different  from the  \fIfull\fR  release as bugs that appear in the release
are not  automatically  removed unless they are explicitly  identified as being
fixed bugs of the release. e.g. in the
.Hh "Bugs Section" idcBUG 4
the  bug  is  closed  with  a  \fBFix  Date:\fR   \fI<release   Name>\fR.  The
\fBspecified\fR release is generally used as a minor release update where only
a number of selected bugs have been fixed.
.IP \fBpatched\fR
The  patched  status is a special  status  assigned to a release,  this is not
officially  a release; but shows the current  state of the bugs in the release
including  patches that have been made. (i.e. it shows the current  state of a
given  release  once any patches  related to that  release have been made. The
\fBpatched\fR  release  is  generally  given  a  \fBDate:\fR  field  value  of
\'\fC*\fR' which indicates that the release extends to the current day.
.RE
.IP "\fBDescription\fR \fI<Formatted Text Description>\fR"
The  description  field  is  used  to  describe  the  release.  This is a text
narrative detailing the content of the release. See
.Hl "Formatted Text Description" idcFormat 4
for a description of the text formatting.
.IP "\fBSee Also:\fR"
Provides a cross  referencing  facility to other  items in the  database  e.g.
previous fault reports or technical notes etc. The items are cross  referenced
as "\fIname\fR(\fIid\fR)" hence to reference fault report 23 then the entry is
specified as \fCbug(23)\fR.
.IP
The other reports are identified as follows:-
.RS
.IP
\fBbug\fR \- Other fault reports.
.br
\fBfaq\fR \- Reference to a Frequently asked question.
.br
\fBtek\fR \- Reference to a Technical Report.

.CE
Considering all of the release entries we have made.
.IP "\fBBeta Release V1.0\fR"
The first  release,  specified as full since when the release is made any bugs
should be cleared down and not show in subsequent releases.
.IP "\fBProduct Release V1.0\fR"
As \fBBeta Release V1.0\fR.
.IP "\fBProduct Release V1.0a\fR"
This release is slightly different in that it is specified. In this case the a
release  is made,  but it may  only  have  fixed a small  number  of  specific
problems,  other  problems in the product may exist and may have  already been
fixed  internally  but they are NOT  included in the release. In this case the
faults (bugs) must reference the release  explicitly (not by date). Those bugs
that  are  explicitly  marked  for the  release  are not  propagated  past the
release. Those that are not show in the release report and are propagated into
the next release report.
.IP "\fBProduct Release V1.1\fR"
As \fBBeta  Release  V1.0\fR.  Note that bugs that were  closed by
.BR "Product Release V1.0a" ,
but  were NOT  specified  in that  release,  will  appear  in this  report  as
\'closed'.  i.e. this is the first  release where that problem was  officially
fixed.
.IP "\fBProduct V1.1 + Patches\fR"
This release is marked as  \fIpatched\fR,  this is an open ended release (i.e.
it is not really a release)  and it shows the current bug state of the release
when all patches have been applied to the release.
.IP "\fBProduct V2.0 Internal Not Released\fR"
This  again  is a  special  entry,  it  indicates  when  the next  release  is
scheduled.  The bugs showing in this release are  propagations  of faults from
previous  releases and new development  problems (i.e. bugs that do not appear
in the product but do currently exist in the development environment).
.NH idcINF 4 "idc(4) - Information Definitions"
.SH "INFORMATION DEFINITIONS"
The  information   section   (\fBinf\fR)  is  provided  for  general  purpose,

fields of the bug report form are missing, these are generally added after the
bug has been progressed by development e.g. patch and suspension information.
.IP "\fBBug Number:\fR \fI<identity>\fR"
A unique number assigned to the bug report. Starting from 1 and incremented on

.IP "\fBLocal\ Id:\ \fI<identity>\fR"
The Local  Identity  field is an optional  field that enables the submitter of
the bug to assign their own identity tag to the fault  report. The  submission
of a bug report  with an  identity  number is  propagated  into the report for
traceability. This enables the submitting person to identify bugs that have been
reported and cross reference back to their own internal lists.

A description of how the fault was fixed. This  information  is generally only
used as a reminder of what was wrong. This is useful where  provided as the
Technical  Support team can relay the  information to the customer if they ask
for it.
.IP
The field supports the standard description formatting constructs.
.IP "\fBSee Also:\fR"
Provides a cross  referencing  facility to other  items in the  database  e.g.
previous fault reports or technical notes etc. The items are cross  referenced
as "\fIname\fR(\fIid\fR)" hence to reference fault report 23 then the entry is
specified as \fCbug(23)\fR.
.IP
The other reports are identified as follows:-
.RS
.IP
\fBbug\fR \- Other fault reports.
.br
\fBfaq\fR \- Reference to a Frequently asked question.
.br
\fBtek\fR \- Reference to a Technical Report.
.br
\fBpat\fR \- Reference to a Patch.
.br
\fBnew\fR \- Refence to a News item.
.RE
.IP
As an exmple, consider the following cross reference list:-
.RS
.CS
See Also: bug(23), bug(345), pat(1),
          new(2), new(4), tek(1),
          faq(23).
.CE
This would generate hypertext links to the specified pages in the document.
.RE
.IP "\fBEnd:\fR"
Terminates the page. Typically only used at the end of a file, bug reports are
automatically  terminated  when  the next  "\fBBug  Number:\fR"  statement  is
encountered.
.LP
Other fields used by engineering include:-
.IP "\fBSuspend By:\fR \fI<Name>\fR"
When a fault is  suspended,  this field  identifies  the name of the  engineer
suspending the fault.
.IP "\fBSuspend Date:\fR \fI<dd/mm/yy>\fR"
The date the fault was suspended.
.IP "\fBSuspend Desc:\fR \fI<Description Text>\fR"
A description  as to why a fault was  suspended.  This conforms to a standard
descriptive field entry.
.IP "\fBUnsuspend By:\fR \fI<Name>\fR"
Name of engineer moving the fault from the suspended list back onto the active
fault list.
.IP "\fBUnsuspend Date:\fR \fI<dd/mm/yy>\fR"
The date when the fault was unsuspended.

.NH idcFormat 4 "idc(4) - Formatted Text Description"
.SH "FORMATTED TEXT DESCRIPTION"
The  free  form  text  entries  allow  a  limited  capability  to  format  the
presentation of the text. The input language to \fBidc\fR is very crude and is
designed for rapid text entry from E-Mail  messages,  typically  submitted  by
engineers.  Text  is  typically  full  of  spelling  mistakes,  typographical
errors  and bad  grammar,  fragments  of code are  typically  included.  Given
the  quality  of input data that is  provided  there  seems  little  point in
providing a  comprehensive  set of formatting  features.  Therefore the basic
constructs are provided:
.BS
Paragraph control
.BU
Code enclosures (raw text / program listings).
.BU
Literal text
.BU
Bulleted lists
.BU
Text indentation control
.BU
Titles
.BE
In addition a small set of in-line formatting constructs are provided that may
be used in a subset of the sections.
.PP
The general  rules for all text items are that they start in at least column 1,
if they start in column 0 then they should not contain a colon  otherwise they
are interpreted as directives.
.PP
Horizontal  and  excess  vertical  white  space is  ignored  unless  otherwise
stated, text is displayed in a proportional font.
.PP
Of the basic  primitives,  only the indentation  may be nested or used within
other primitives.
.SS "Paragraph Control"
A paragraph is defined as consecutive  lines of text  terminating with either a
control  word or blank line. All lines in the  paragraph  should  start with a
space or not include a colon character (\fC:\fR).
All  of  the  text   comprising  the  paragraph  is  left   justified  to  the
current   indentation   level  and  text   adjustment  is  applied  (i.e.  the
white space  intervals are ignored).
.PP
Paragraphs are displayed in a proportional font.
.SS "Code Enclosure"
Code  Enclosure's  enable literal, space formatted text, to be retained in the
resultant  output  display.  Typically  used  for  code  fragments  where  the
formatting of a line has to be retained.
.PP
Code  segments  are  delimited  by  use of  the  "\fBcode:\fR"  "\fBecode:\fR"
primitives   that  appear  in  the  margin.  All   vertical   white  space  is
preserved.  Horizontal  white space is  honoured,  with the  exception  of the
leading  indent, the  minimum  leading  indent (for all lines) is  stripped  off
the lines thereby controlling the left indent.
.PP
Code enclosures are displayed in a mono-spaced font, an indentation is applied.
Consider the following example:
.CS
    According to the customer, they all fail the same way.

    Any other ideas? Can someone  over there verify parsing
    error with the keyword?

    I got the same error:

code:
    vcrun -D DVS_TRACKER=glove dvise vdifiles/gallery.vdi

    ERROR   [foo-bar:input] ParseTrackerConfig
            : file glove.inp, line 22 :

.SS "Literal Text"
Where you have a list of items that are short then you can use  literal  text,
this preserves the vertical line spacing, but not the horizontal  white space.
Typically  used for address fields etc.  Literal text  lines are displayed in a
proportional font.
.CS
literal:
    Acme Ltd,
    Acme House,
    Mayfair,
    LONDON.
eliteral:
.CE
This generates:-
.IP
.nf

.fi
.SS "Bulleted Lists"
Bulleted  lists  provide an effective  mechanism for itemised text lists. Data
entry is similar to a paragraph, Each bullet item is
separated   by  a  single   line,  the   bulleted   lines  are  encased  in  a
"\fBbullet:\fR" "\fBebullet:\fR" construct.
.PP
Bullet lists are indented and displayed in a proportional font. e.g.
.CS
bullet:
    Item A - This is some text
             can occupy many
             lines, so long as the next line
             is blank.

    Item B - This is the next item

    Item C - This is                the following item.
ebullet:
.CE
This generates:
.BS 1
Item A - This is some text can occupy  many lines, so long as the next line is
blank.
.BU
Item B - This is the next item
.BU
Item C - This is                the following item.
.BE 0
.SS "Indentation"
The  indentation  structure  provides a mechanism to adjust the left margin of
displayed text. The syntax uses keywords  "\fBindent:\fR"  "\fBeindent:\fR" to
indent a block of text between the opening and closing indent  statements. The
indentations  may be nested and may  additionally  include the  "\fBcode:\fR",
"\fBbullet:\fR", "\fBliteral:\fR" and "\fBtitle:\fR" fields.
.PP
As an example of the indented text consider the following:-
.CS
    Not indented.
indent:
    This is indented.
indent:
        Indented some more.
code:
        Bit of code.
ecode:

.SS "Title"
Title lines,  displayed in a \fBbold\fR text font may be specified,  using the
enclosure \fBtitle:\fR \fBetitle:\fR enclosure. All paragraphs contained within
the title  enclosure  are  displayed in bold. This is typically  used with the
\fBindent:\fR statement.
.PP
As an example consider the following:
.CS
title:
    Title Level 0
etitle:
indent:
    Level 0 text.
title:
    Title Level 1
etitle:
indent:
    Level 1 text.
eindent:

.SH "IN-LINE FORMATTING CONSTRUCTS"
The In-line formatting  constructs provide methods to change the font type and
to  include  special  hyper-text  references  which  may be  used  within  the
generated HTML (as opposed to RTF). The basic constructs are defined as:-
.BS
Bold \- embolden font.
.BU
Italic \- italicise font.
.BU
Courier \- monospaced font (Courier).
.BE
The set of hypertext extensions include:
.BS
Mailto \- Mail reference to named recipient(s).
.BU
Ftp \- FTP reference to a file for download.
.BU
Http \- Hypertext reference, typically to a network \fIhtml\fR file.
.BU
File \- Hypertext reference, typically to a local \fIhtml\fR file.
.BE
The general syntax is defined as:-
.PP
.RS

.PP
The  font  specifiers   \fBb:\fR,   \fBi:\fR  and  \fBc:\fR  change  the  font
characteristics of all of the \fI<text>\fR on the line.
.PP
The hypertext specifiers  optionally take two arguments, the first is the name
of the  hypertext  link this is  specified  as a standard WWW browser  address
(without  the \fC//\fR  delimiters).  The optional  \fI<label  text>\fR  field
specifies  the text to be used to hide the link. If omitted then the line name
is used. The Windows Help File  generation  shows the \fI<label  text>\fR with
the regular text if included, the \fI<* address>\fR  field is always displayed
in red.
.PP
The field specifiers may be used in the following fields only, their effect is
defined as follows:
.PP
\fBRegular Paragraph\fR
