.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual pages describes the JASSPA  \fBmad\fR  macro  interface used in
conjunction with
.Hr groff 1 ,
the GNU version of
.Hr troff 1 ,
which is part of the groff document formating system.
.SH OPTIONS
The \fBgroff\fR options are defined as follows:-
.BP -mad
Inform the converter to use the JASSAP document formating macros.
.IP "\fB-T\fR\fIname\fR"
Prepare output for the named device. The devices  usually used are \fBASCII\fR
which  generates  an ASCII output for use as a  \fIcatman\fR  page or \fIps\fR
which  generates a postscript  output. If the \fB-T\fR  option is omitted then
the default is postscript.
.IP "\fB-rT1\fR"
This is a special  flag used by the  \fBmad\fR  macros. This enables text mode
processing for  \fIcatman\fR  pages and should be used with the  \fB-Tascii\fR
device.
.SH "USAGE"
Two types of command line are typically used as follows:-
.IP "ASCII catman manual pages"
\fBgroff\ -rT1\ -Tascii\ -mad\fR \fIfiles...\fR
.IP "Postscript Printer Pages"
\fBgroff\ -mad\fR \fIfiles...\fR
.SH "MACRO DEFINITIONS"
The following is list of the most  frequently  used  commands.  They have been
segmented into groups on  functionality.  They are shown here for  information
only,  reference  should  be  made  to  the  official  manual  pages  if  more
information is required, however the use of complex n/troff formating commands
is  discouraged as the not all converters  support these features (e.g. HTML &
RTF converters).
.PP
The  documented  subset of commands has been selected to enable  converters to
\fBHTML\fR and
.B  "Rich Text"
(rtf) to be constructed that will generate
.Hr Mosaic 1
and
.I "Microsoft Windows Help"
compliant files.
.SS "Starting and Ending the File"
The following keywords are used at the start or end of the file.
.IP "\fB\.Id\fR $Id: mad.7,v 1.1 2000-10-21 14:31:34 jon Exp $"
This is an
.Hr RCS 1
identity  string and should be located on the very first line of the file. The
information   in  the  string  is  added  to  the  manual   page   footer  and
\fBIDENTIFICATION\fR  section.  The fields  within the \fB$ID\ ..\ $\fR string
are defined by
.Hr RCS 1 .
The special string  \fB\\\&*\&(Dt\fR  is extracted from the \fB\.Id\fR  string
which contains the date, extracted from the RCS string (\fI1994/04/27\fR).
.IP "\fB\.Im\fR \fIsoftware-module\fR [\fIcategory\fR]"
Module  identity  string. This is an extension  macro. This defines the module
and component of the manual page. The \fIsoftware-module\fR is the name of the
software  package to which the manual page  belongs.  This is  specified  as a
lower case string. 
.IP
The  \fIsoftware-module\fR  string is used to automatically generate the title
heading. This ensures that all documents are consistent.
.IP
The \fIcategory\fR field is an optional field which is additional  information
used to construct groups of commands. The
.Ht nrsearch 1
utility uses this field to construct  category indexes for higher level manual
pages. Hence  manual  pages should be assigned a category  for this search. If
the  field  is  omitted  then  the  default  is  \fImisc\fR  which  represents
miscellaneous  information that cannot be grouped sensibly. As an example, the
\fIdvstools\fR  are  divided  up into  two  categories,  \fIconverters\fR  and
\fIoptimisers\fR. A utility such as
.Hr 3ds2vdi 1
is a converter, as is
.Hr dxf2vdi 1 ,
.Hr bizreduce 1 
is a optimiser, where as
.Hr bizscale 1
is classed as miscellaneous and the  \fIcategory\fR  field is undefined. Hence
the definition for
.Hr 3ds2vdi 1
is defined as:-
.RS
.CS
\.Im dvstools converters
.CE 0
.RE
.IP
where as 
.Hr bizscale 1
is defined as:-
.RS
.CS
\.Im dvstools
.CE 0
.RE
.IP
The  \fIcategory\fR  may be  composed  of  sub-categories  using a  semi-colon
\fC;\fR to separate the  sub-component.  Components  may be sub-divided to any
depth. Where a manual page exists in multiple  categories  then the categories
may be sub-divided by a \fC|\fR. e.g.
.RS
.CS
\.Im vc category1;foos|category2;bars
.CE 0
.RE
.IP 
Defines a manual  page that  exists  in two  categories;  \fIcategory1\fR  and
\fIcategory2\fR.
.IP "\fB\.TH\fR \fImodule\ section\ left\ centre-footer\ left-footer\ heading\fR"
Title header  definition,  this  immediately  follows the \fB\.Id\fR  line and
defines  the  title  blocks  to be used on the  page. The  \fIsection-left\fR,
\fIcentre-footer\fR and \fIheading\fR should be omitted as this information is
filled in automatically  using  information  collected from the \fB\.Id\fR and
\fB\.Im\fR fields. This manual page was defined with the following  \fB\.TH\fR
line.
.RS

.RE 
.IP
The  \fIsection\fR  field identifies the information in the file. The standard
extensions are defined as follows:-
.PP
.RS
.RS
.nf
\fB1\fR - A executable module.
\fB3\fR - A function interface.
\fB4\fR - A file definition.
\fB5\fR - A data structure definition.
.fi
.RE
.RE
.BP .FH
Footer  heading.  This  appears at the end of the file and defines  additional
information automatically when required. This must be present.
.IP "\fB\.XI\fR \fIname\fR [\fIsection\fR] [\fIdescription\fR] [\fIcategory\fR]"
Define  a  cross  index  entry  of  \fIname\fR.  This is  used  for  automatic
generation of the manual pages, and for construction of the permutated  index.
The first  \fB\.XI\fR entry  encountered  MUST be the name of the manual page.
Subsequent  \fB\.XI\fR  entries  encountered  generate a symbolic  link to the
first  manual  page  and the  entry is made  available  from the  \fBman\fR(1)
command.
.IP
The \fIsection\fR field, generally omitted, defines the section in which cross
reference is made. This is supported  so that data  structures  may be defined
within a \fB\.3\fR manual page but may be given the correct  referencing  name
(e.g.  \fB\.5\fR).  When  omitted, or  specified as \fC\-\fR  then the section
number defaults to the section specified in \fB\.TH\fR. The \fB\.XI\fR entries
are used by the manual  generation tools which uses the first \fB\.XI\fR entry
and renames  the files to  \fIname.x\fR  where  \fIx\fR is the section  number
defined  in the  \fB\.TH\fR  macro.  Hence  the  name of the  source  file  is
irrelevant to the final generation of the manual page.
.IP
The \fB\.XI\fR must follow immediately after the \fB\.TH\fR section.
.IP
The \fIdescrption\fR field contains a description of the entry. This should be
a concise description of the entry which is used in the index generation by
.Ht nrsearch 1 .
The description must be quoted with double qoutes (\fB"\fR).
.IP
The \fIcategory\fR  field defines the category of the manual page entry, which
is used in addition to the \fB\.Im\fR  \fIcategory\fR field. This is typically
used to bind  specific  manual  page  entries to a category.  The field may be
considered to be an alturnative category entry.
.IP "\fB\.Kw\fR \fIstrings..\fR" 
This field enables key words to be defined for hyper-text systems that support
topic indexs (e.g.  Windows). This  generates an entry in the topic index that
refers to this page. The stings must be  specified  in quotes and may  include
white space.
.BP Examples
The  heading  of a  document  file may be defined as  follows.  Note that this
document has two references
.BR mad (7)
and
.BR tmac.ad (7).

.RE
.SS "Hyper-text Links"
In order  to make  hyper-text  links  to  other  documents  then a  number  of
additional  constructs  have been added to the nroff marco set to describe the
association.  When building  Windows Help or Mosaic HTML pages a Help Compiler
is used to  resolve  all of the  references  and link the  pages  together.  A
definition is declared as \fB\.XI\fR as described in the previous section, the
references are defined as follows:-
.IP "\fB\.Ht\fR \fIname\fR \fIsection\fR [\fIconcat\fR] [\fImodule\fR \fIfile\fR]"
This macro  defines a Hyper-text  link to another  definition  that is defined
within the JASSPA  Manual page set. The \fIname\fR  field is the name of the
reference,  \fIsection\fR  is the section number as assigned in the \fB\.TH\fR
or \fB\.XI\fR macros. The \fIname\fR field is displayed in a bold or hypertext
font, the  \fIsection\fR  number is  displayed in the normal font and inserted
into a bracket. The  \fIconcat\fR  field is text that abuts the  reference, if
this  field  is  omitted  than a single  space  follows  the  reference.  e.g.
Consider the reference to
.Ht mad 7 
and
.Ht tmac.ad 7 ,
this would be entered as:-
.RS
.CS
.ne 4
\.Ht mad 7 
and
\.Ht tmac.ad 7 ,
this would be entered as:-
.CE 0
.RE
.IP
Note the  positioning  of the comma in the text  (\fIconcat\fR  field) and the
resultant output (what you are reading !!).
.IP
The optional \fImodule\fR and \fIfile\fR arguments are used by the compilation
options of
.Ht nr2html 1
and
.Ht nr2rtf 1
and allow an  explicit  external  reference  to be made to a named  label in a
different module. The arguments provide the explicit linkage  information that
enables the hypertext  modules to resolve the reference  without  knowledge of
the label. The  linkage  options  are ONLY used for menu type  pages that only
appear  in  the  hypertext  environment.  If  the  labels  are  used  and  the
\fIconcat\fR field is not required then it may be specified as \fC-\fR.
.IP "\fB\.Hl\fR \fItext\fR \fIname\fR \fIsection\fR [\fIconcat\fR] [\fImodule\fR \fIfile\fR]"
This macro  defines a hyper-text  link to another  definition  that is defined
within the JASSPA manual pages. This differs from the \fB\.Ht\fR in that the
text that is displayed by the link is  specified  separatly by the  \fItext\fR
field.  The  \fItext\fR  field  should be  specified  in  double  quotes if it
includes any white space  characters. The remaining  arguments are the same as
\fB\.Ht\fR.
.IP
The \fB\.Hl\fR  linakge is generally used for hyper-text menu construction and
for accessing pages defined with the \fB\.NH\fR command.
.IP
Consider a reference to
.Ht mad 7 
with an alternative  text label of "\fCNroff  Hypertext  Extensions\fR",  this
would be specified as:-
.IP
.RS
.C 
\.Hl "Nroff Hypertet Extensions" mad 7 
.RE
.IP
Which generates a label of:
.IP
.RS
.Hl "Nroff Hypertet Extensions" mad 7 
.RE
.IP "\fB\.Hr\fR \fIname\fR [\fIsection\fR] [\fIconcat\fR]"
The  hyper   reference   makes  a  reference  to  something   outside  of  our
documentation system e.g. the 'C' Compiler which is referenced as
.Hr cc 1 .
This is the same  format as the  \fB\.Ht\fR  macro  except  that a hyper  text
reference is not normally generated. Hence the compiler reference shown in the
previous sentence is generated as:-
.RS
.CS
\.Hr cc 1 .
.CE 0
.RE
.IP "\fB\.NH\fR \fIname\fR \fIsection\fR \fItitle\fR [\fIfile\fR]"
The  \fB\.NH\fR  macro is  similar  to  \fB\.TH\fR  in that it  defines  a new
hypertext  page. The macro is  ignored  by  Nroff/Troff  formaters,  hypertext
formaters  generate a new page with the specified  \fItitle\fR. The \fIname\fR
and \fIsection\fR  arguments  provides the name of the page which is generally
cross referenced by a \fB\.Hl\fR reference. The \fIsection\fR may be defaulted
by a \fC-\fR passed as an argument. The \fIfile\fR optional argument specifies
the named of the generated hypertext file under
.Ht nr2html 1 ,
when omitted then an automatic name is assigned.
.SS "Character Fonts"
This section  defines the character font changes that may be used in the text.
There are two methods of introducing a font change, either by embedding  codes
directly  in the text, or by using  commands.  The  embedded  codes begin with
\fB\\\&f\fR\fIX\fR  while  the  commands  must  appear at the  start of a line
denoted by a \fB\.\fR\fIXX\fR.
.IP "\fB\.B\fR [\fIbarg\fR] [\fIparg\fR]"
Set \fIbarg\fR in bold and \fIparg\fR in the previous font; up to 6 arguments.
.IP "\fB\.BI\fR [\fIbarg\fR] [\fIiarg\fR]"
Set  \fIbarg\fR  in  bold  and  \fIiarg\fR  in  italics;  up  to  6  arguments
alternating between the fonts.
.IP "\fB\.BR\fR [\fIbarg\fR] [\fIrarg\fR]"
Set \fIbarg\fR in bold and \fIrarg\fR in Roman; up to 6 arguments  alternating
between the fonts.
.IP "\fB\.I\fR [\fIiarg\fR] [\fIparg\fR]"
Set  \fIiarg\fR  in  italic  and  \fIparg\fR  in the  previous  font;  up to 6
arguments.
.IP "\fB\.IB\fR [\fIiarg\fR] [\fIbarg\fR]"
Set \fIiarg\fR in italic and \fIbarg\fR in bold; up to 6 arguments alternating
between the fonts.
.IP "\fB\.IR\fR [\fIiarg\fR] [\fIrarg\fR]"
Set  \fIiarg\fR  in  italic  and  \fIrarg\fR  in  roman;  up  to  6  arguments
alternating between the fonts.
.IP "\fB\.R\fR"
Return to roman font.
.IP "\fB\.RB\fR [\fIrarg\fR] [\fIbarg\fR]"
Set \fIrarg\fR in Roman and \fIbarg\fR in bold; up to 6 arguments  alternating
between the fonts.
.IP "\fB\.RI\fR [\fIrarg\fR] [\fIiarg\fR]"
Set  \fIrarg\fR  in  Roman  and  \fIiarg\fR  in  italic;  up  to  6  arguments
alternating between the fonts.
.IP "\fB\.CS\fR [\fIcount\fR]"
Start of a code  section, the code section is used for inserts  such as source
code examples. This forces a blank line, advances the  indentation  margin and
changes  the font to 8 point fixed  space  courier.  \fB\.CS\fR  mode  remains
active until a closing \fB\.CE\fR is encountered. While the \fB\.CS\fR section
is  active  justification  and  line  wrapping  is  disabled  and all  text is
propagated  from the \fBroff\fR file as laid out. No embedded font changes may
be defined in this section. \fIcount\fR specifies the number of blank lines to
leave  between the  previous  paragraph  and the text code, the  default  when
omitted is one blank line.
.IP "\fB\.CE\fR [\fIcount\fR]"
End  of  code   section,   returns   the  text   style   back  into  10  point
Roman.\fIcount\fR  specifies  the number of blank  lines to leave  between the
text code and the next paragraph, the default when omitted is one blank line.
.IP "\fB\\\\\&f\&B\fR"
Embedded change to bold font. e.g., Hello\\\&f\&BWorld\\\&f\&RHello  generates
Hello\fBWorld\fRHello.
.IP "\fB\\\\\&f\&C\fR"
Embedded change to Mono [Teletype] font.
.IP "\fB\\\\\&f\&I\fR"
Embedded change to italic font.
.IP "\fB\\\\\&f\&P\fR"
Embedded change to previous font.
.IP "\fB\\\\\&f\&R\fR"
Embedded change to Roman font.
.SS "Sections and Paragraphs"
This section describes the line and paragraph formating commands.
.IP "\fB\.SH\fR \fItitle\fR"
Section  heading,  denoting  the start of a new section with  associated  text
defined by \fItitle\fR. The \fItitle\fR may only be a single  parameter, hence
if the title contains any spaces it should be  encapsulated  in double quotes.
The new  section  resets the margins to their  defaults  sets the text back to
Roman,  produces  a blank  line  followed  by the  \fItitle\fR  in bold in the
margin. Typically the
.B .SH
titles are specified in capital letters in a manual page.
.IP "\fB\.SS\fR \fItitle\fR"
Sub\-section heading, denoting the start of a new sub\-section with associated
text  defined  by  \fItitle\fR.  The  \fB\.SS\fR  command  is the  same as the
\fB\.SH\fR  command,  except the  \fItitle\fR  is  indented  by 1/2 the margin
width. Typically the \fB\.SH\fR  titles are capitalised in a manual page (e.g.
capital letter then lower case on each word).
.IP "\fB\.IP\fR \fIlabel\fR"
Indent  paragraph with hanging  \fIlabel\fR.  \fB\.RS\fR and \fB\.RE\fR can be
used for nested indents.
.IP "\fB\.BP\fR \fIlabel\fR"
Bold  indented  paragraph  as per  \fB\.IP\fR  and is used as a shorthand  for
\fB\.IP\fR\   \\\&fB\fItitle\fR\\\&fR.  This  is  generally  used  for  option
definition.
.IP "\fB\.LP\fR"
Start block paragraph. Interparagraph spacing is typically 1 line.
.IP "\fB\.PP\fR"
Start of a new paragraph. A blank line is generated and the margins are reset.
.BP .RS
Right Shift.  Increase  the  relative  indent one level. End with  \fB\.RE\fR.
often used with \fB\.IP\fR.
.BP .RE
End one level of relative indent started with \fB\.RS\fR.
.SS "Comment Commands"
The comments may be used to convey  information  to the nroff  converter.  The
syntax is defined as follows:-
.PP
.RS
\fC.\\" \fIcommand-word\fR \fIdata\fR
.RE
.PP
The commands are defined as follows:-
.IP "\fCIGNORE\fR \fIany-text\fR"
Ignores errors and warnings generated by the next command only.
.IP "\fCIGNORE-ERROR\fR \fIany-text\fR"
Ignores any errors generated by the next command only.
.IP "\fCIGNORE-WARNING\fR \fIany-text\fR"
Ignores any warnings generated by the next command only.
.IP "\fCERROR\fR \fIerror-text\fR"
Generates an error message using the rest of the line  \fIerror-text\fR as the
message.
.IP "\fCWARNING\fR \fIwarning-text\fR"
Generates a warning message using the rest of the line  \fIwarning-text\fR  as
the message.
.PP
As an example, the following command generates a used defined error, typically
used to mark a manual page with information that is missing.
.CS
\.\\" ERROR Need to add some text here.
.CE
This would generate:
.CS
ERROR: mad.7: 484: In-line [Need to add some text here.]
.CE 0
.SS "Useful nroff/troff commands"
The following is an abridged list of useful nroff commands.
.IP "\fB\.ad\fR [\fIc\fR]"
Adjust  output  lines  according to format  \fIc\fR. Fill mode must be on (see
\fB\.fi\fR).  With no  argument,  return to previous  adjustment.  The current
adjustment mode is stored in register  \fB\.j\fR with the following  values:\-
\fI0=l\fR, \fI1=b\fR, \fI3=c\fR, \fI5=r\fR (see \fB\.na\fR).
.IP
Values of \fIc\fR are defined as follows:\-

\fB\.j\fR. See also \fB\.ad\fR.
.IP "\fB\.ne\fR \fIn\fR" 
If \fIn\fR lines do not remain on this page, start a new page.
.BP .nf
Do not fill or adjust the output lines. See also \fB\.ad\fR and \fB\.fi\fR.
.IP "\fB\.ps\fR \fIn\fR"
Set point size to \fIn\fR  (troff/rtf only, restricted use with HTML). Typical
value is 10 point. Code blocks are 8 point. See also \fB\.vs\fR.
.\".IP "\fB\.nx\fR \fIfile\fR"
.\"Switch to \fIfile\fR and do not return to the current file. See also
.\"\&\fB\.so\fR. 
.IP "\fB\.so\fR \fIfile\fR"

Leave \fIn\fR blank lines. Default is 1.
.IP "\fB\.vs\fR [\fIn\fR]"
Set  vertical  line  spacing  to \fIn\fR.  If no  argument,  restore  previous
spacing.  Default  is 1/6 inch in nroff, 12 points in troff.  Usually  used in
conjunction  with  \fB\.ps\fR,  the  \fIn\fR is  typically  set to be 2 points
larger than the font size defined by \fB\.ps\fR.
.SS "Escape seqences"
The standard escape sequences are defined as follows:\-
.br
.BP "\\\\\\\\"
Prevent or delay the interpretation of \\.
.BP "\\\\\\-"
Minus sign (\fC\-\fR) in the current font.
.IP "\fB\\\\\fR\fI<space>\fR"
Unpaddable space\-size space character.
.IP "\fB\\\\\fR\fI<newline>\fR"
Concealed (ignored) newline.

.SS "Macro Variables"
Macro variables may be defined as a short hand to continually  reproducing the
same text. Macros are defined using the following syntax:-
.CS
\.ds X Text is here
.CE 0
.\" IGNORE-WARNING A .CE 0 causes a warning here - ignore it !!
or
.\" IGNORE-WARNING A .CS 0 causes a warning here - ignore it !!
.CS 0
\.ds YY Text is here 
.CE
When  starting  with white space use a  double-quote  (\fC"\fR),  not that the
quote is NOT terinated with an ending quote. e.g.
.CS
\.ds X "  Text is here starting with 2x white space
.CE
The variable is referenced as \fB\\*X\fR or \fB\\*(YY\fR  depending on whether
it is a one or two letter macro name.
.PP
Defined names may be subsequently removed using with:-
.CS
\.rm X
.CE 0
.\" IGNORE-WARNING A .CE 0 causes a warning here - ignore it !!
or
.\" IGNORE-WARNING A .CS 0 causes a warning here - ignore it !!
.CS 0
\.rm YY
.CE
If  you  are  using  two  letter  names,  the  standard  Nroff  convention  is
capitalised so as to avoid conflict with the internal register names etc.
.PP
Consider the following example:-
.CS
\.ds Hw Hello World
This [\\*(Hw] is in Bold [\\fB\\*(Hw\\fR] or italic [\\fI\\*(Hw\\fR].
\.rm Hw
.CE
This generates :-
.PP
.RS
This [Hello World] is in Bold [\fBHello World\fR] or italic
[\fIHello\ World\fR].
.RE
.SH "CONVENTIONS"
The conventions used in the manual pages are defined as follows:-
.SS "Standard Sections"
The \fINAME\fR section contains the name of the utility and a single
line description.
.PP
The  \fISYNOPSIS\fR  section  describes the  interface. For an executable  the
command is specified in bold face, any associated  options are bold face while
parameter names are shown in italic. For 'C' function prototypes and structure
definitions,  the name of the subject is bold face,  parameters are defined in
italic. Other text not in these categories is Roman face.
.PP
For both types of definition  unpaddable spaces should be placed between items
which  cannot be split  across  lines. e.g. in a 'C'  function  definition  an
unpaddable  space should be placed  between the parameter  type and  parameter
name. This ensures that the text always appears on the same line.
.PP
The  \fIDESCRIPTION\fR  section  describes  the operation of the subject, this
should  describe  both the  operation  and  parameter  and/or  options  of the
subject(s).  References to other tools should be made in bold font  indicating
the  existing  manual  page  section  number  e.g.   \fBman\fR(1).   The  font
conventions used in the \fISYNOPSIS\fR section are used.
.PP
The  \fIDIAGNOSTICS\fR  section describes any return or result values produced
by the subject(s).
.PP
The \fIEXAMPLE\fR section comprises a number of examples  highlighting the use
of the subject. This  comprises a narrative  description  and a worked example
perhaps  including the results of the operation. The example  itself should be
placed in a  \fB\.CS\fR/.\fBCE\fR  pairing to highlight the example text. When
doing code  inserts etc ensure that the line  lengths do not exceed  column 70
otherwise wrapping will occur on the generated output.
.PP
The \fISEE\  ALSO\fR  section is a cross  reference  to other  related  manual
pages.  There  are  defined  as a comma  separated  list in  italic  font e.g.
\fIman\fR(1), \fIgroff\fR(1).
.PP
Additional  sections  may  be  added  such  as  \fINOTES\fR  where  additional
information  relevant to the reader may be placed. A section  call  \fIBUGS\fR
may be included if a subject behaves badly under certain conditions, typically
this  exception  conditions  and side  effects are  described.  A  \fIUSAGE\fR
section may be used to describe the specific usage of a subject.
.SH "Standard Techniques for defining components"
There are a number of standard  techniques for defining  pieces of text in the
document. The main text pieces are discussed in the following sections:-
.SS "Function Invocations"
Within the  \fISYOPSIS\fR  section the function  calls and/or data is defined.
The function  name is  specified in bold font, the  parameters  are defined in
italic font. A function definition would be defined as follows:-
.PP
.RS
.na
#include <\fIincludeName\fR>

char\ *\fBMyFunction1\fR
(int\ \fIparameter1\fR,
char\ *\fIparameter2\fR,
void\ *\fIparameter3\fR,
struct myStruct\ *\fIparameter3\fR)
.br
char\ *\fBMyFunction2\fR
(int\ \fIparameter1\fR,
char\ *\fIparameter2\fR,
void\ *\fIparameter3\fR,
struct\ myStruct\ *\fIparameter3\fR)
.ad
.RE
.PP
This is defined as:-
.CS
\.na
#include <\\\&fIinclude Name\\\&fR>

\.ad
.CE 0
.SS "Data Structure Definitions"
Within the \fISYOPSIS\fR section the data definitions are defined. Type
definitions are defined with a bold font, the contents are in a normal font.
A data definition would be defined as follows (extract from VC):-
.PP
.na
.nf
#include <dvs/vc.h>

typedef\ struct {
.RS
InstanceNo  user;
int32  verbose;
int32  enable;
char8  log [4];
char8  config [1];
.RE
} \fBVCConfigReply\fR, *\fBVCConfigReply_Ptr\fR;

const ElementHandle\ \fBel_VCConfigReply\fR;
.fi
.ad
.PP
This is defined in nroff as follows:-
.CS
\.na
\.nf
#include <dvs/vc.h>

typedef struct {
\.RS
InstanceNo  user;
int32  verbose;
int32  enable;
char8  log [4];
char8  config [1];
\.RE
} \\\&fBVCConfigReply\\\&fR, *\\\&fBVCConfigReply_Ptr\\\&fR;

const ElementHandle\ \\\&fBel_VCConfigReply\\\&fR;
\.fi
\.ad
.CE 0
.SS "SEE ALSO section"
The \fISEE\ ALSO\fR section is generally defined as a set of hyper-text links
which are not right justified. Hence a see also section of:-
.PP
.RS
.B "SEE ALSO"
.br

.SH "Converter Tools"
The following converter tools have been developed, or are available, to process the NROFF files,
all of the utilities mentioned are currently residing in DOS world.
.TP
.Hl nr2rtf nr2rtf 1   
Converts the nroff pages described to Rich Text Format (RTF) for use by the
Windows help compiler 
.Hr hc31 1 .
.TP
.Hl nr2html nr2html 1
Converts the nroff pages to HTML format used by
