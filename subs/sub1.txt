Title:  ME as download-monster

Sometimes it is difficult to download  entire web pages full of  advertisement
but with many  'next'-buttons.  Usually  other  download-programs  are failing
here. With 11 lines of code ME (with URL-support) beats them all:

Try find-file "http://www.itknowledge.com/reference/archive/1571690638/ch01/030-033.html"

and run the download-next  macro defined below, if you are happy, press '!' to
avoid  debugging and ME will fetch almost twenty pages, if they are containing
the proper  'next'-links.  If something goes wrong just press "CTRL+G". If you
can't work with the mouse later just press again "!" !!!!

Happy fetching...
