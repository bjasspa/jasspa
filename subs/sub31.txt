Title:  Man page hilighting extensions for Linux

The manual pages in later  versions of Linux (RH 9.0) appear to use additional
character escape sequences to represent some standard 7-bit ASCII  characters.
The character  escape sequences need to be translated in order for the correct
character  represenation  to be presented. I am not sure why the new character
sequences are used unless this is some side effect of the locale.

The  following  extension  is added to  myman.emf  and performs the  necessary
translations  to  correct  the  presentation.  A  definitive  list  of  escape
sequences  has  not  been  found,  the  sequences  presented  here  are  noted
anomalies.

The  following  extension  is added to  myman.emf  and extends the  hilighting
scheme to perform  the  translation.  Extract  the code body to a file  called
"myman.emf"  (or append to the end of an  existing  file) and add this to your
private "jasspa" directory which is:-

    ~/.jasspa/ on UNIX.
    $APPDATA\jasspa on Windows.

Adding Translations
-------------------

Where  further  anomalies  are  noted  then  additional  translations  may  be
required. To determine the  translation  sequence then the following steps may
be followed:-

    1. Within the "*Man on xxx" buffer  remove the buffer  hilighting to fully
       reveal the escape code.

       esc-x set-variable $buffer-hilight 0

    2. With  the  buffer  hilighting  removed  the  escape  sequences  appear.
       Determine the escape  sequence that is causing a problem.  Translations
       should be added to  "myman.emf"  for the 'normal',  'bold' and 'italic'
       cases which may be  determined  from the type of escape  sequence.  The
       general format of the 3 character escape sequences are:-

       \xAA\xBB\xCC                 - Normal ($global-scheme)
       _\CH\xAA\xBB\xCC             - Italic
       \xAA\xBB\xCC\CH\xAA\xBB\xCC  - Bold

       Where "AA", "BB" and "CC" are hexadecimal  values. "\CH" is 'control-h'
       which may be displayed as "^H". In some instances one of the characters
       may be rendered as a special glyph, the character hexadecimal value may
       be determined by placing the cursor on the character and displaying the
       hexadecimal character value using "C-x =" (or esc-x buffer-info).

    3. With the  translations  added then from within the  "myman.emf"  buffer
       execute it using "esc-x  execute-buffer".  The new translations  should
       now be  loaded  and may be  viewed  by  restoring  the  $buffer-hilight
       variable or deleting  the "*Man on xxx" buffer and  re-issuing  the man
       command.
