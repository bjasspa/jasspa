The macro  'save-region'  saves the  currently  selected  region (that
exists  between  Point and Mark) to file. The user is prompted for the
filename.

Add the following macro fragment to your start-up <user>.emf

==== save-region start =================================================

define-macro save-region
    ; Copy the text and create a new buffer for the text
    copy-region
    !force 0 delete-buffer  "*save-region*"
    find-buffer "*save-region*"
    yank
    ; Fix the undo history and write the buffer to 
    ; a file. Pretend we are not a macro so that 
    ; the user is prompted correctly at the file 
    ; interaction. Finally clean up and delete
    ; the buffer. Note that the buffer name changes
    ; if the file is written so use the macro variable
    ; to get the correct buffer name.
    -2 yank
    !force !nma write-buffer @ml01 "Filename "
    !force 0 delete-buffer $buffer-bname
!emacro

==== save-region end =================================================
