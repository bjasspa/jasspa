One  thing  I do a lot is  look at  logfiles  in ME.  It's  fast  loading  and
searching  speed and  seemingly  limitless  capacity  (unlike vi ["window  too
wide"] and Notepad) make it wonderful for this.  Naturally, as a power user, I
want it all, and in this  case the  feature I need is an  ability  to reload a
file. So I cooked up the following to reread a file:

==== reread_file.emf start ===================================================

;------------------------------------------------------------
; reread-file: reload the current file (w/ safety prompt)
;------------------------------------------------------------
define-macro reread-file
    set-variable #l1 $window-aline
    set-variable #l2 $buffer-fname
    !if &bmod "edit"
        !if &iseq @mc1 "Buffer has been changed; reread anyway [y/n]? " "yYnN" "n"
            !abort
        !endif
    !endif
    0 delete-buffer $buffer-bname  ; force destroy (prompting user doesn't work in macro)
    ml-write &spr "[Rereading %s]" #l2
    read-file #l2
    #l1 goto-line
!emacro
!force global-bind-key reread-file "C-x f"

==== reread_file.emf end =====================================================
