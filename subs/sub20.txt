As of the July 2001  release  then  previous  buffer may be  evaluated
using:-

    -1 next-buffer

Hence a ley  binding  in the July 2001  release  should be  defined as
follows.  Assuming  that "f6" allows you to move  between the previous
and next buffers, the binding may be defined as follows:-

        -1 global-bind-key next-buffer "S-f6"  ; previous-buffer
        global-bind-key next-buffer "f6"       ; next-buffer

If you  require a command  called  "previous-buffer"  then  define the
macro as follows:-

    define-macro previous-buffer
        &neg @# next-buffer
    !emacro

The @# processing propogates the numeric argument so

    2 previous-buffer

goes back 2 buffers,

    -2 previous-buffer

goes forward 2 buffers !!
