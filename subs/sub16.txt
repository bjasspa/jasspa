On win32  platforms  the use of man inside ME is disabled, if you have
the  cygwin  tools  installed  you  can  write a  batchfile  like  the
following (Versions of cygwin later than B20):

==== man.bat start =================================================
@echo off
rem script to launch cygwin man utility from MicroEmacs
set PATH=C:\cygwin\bin;%PATH%
C:\cygwin\bin\man.exe -C /lib/man.conf %1 %2 %3 %4 %5
==== man.bat end =================================================

Now put man.bat  into your  executable  PATH.  Within your  <user.emf>
enable the man page  processing  macros, do this by  defining  the man
macros i.e.:-

define-macro-file hkman man

Close down the editor and restart, the manual pages may be invoked by

    esc-x man

Enter the manual page at the prompt. i.e.

    Man On: fprintf
    Man On: 3x cbreak

NOTE:- The man.bat may be placed in your  MicroEmacs  directory  which
       contains  me32.exe.  Within  Windows the shortcut  will execute
       from this directory location and find the .bat file.

       You can test that me32 can see the executable by using:-

            esc-x which
            Program Name: man

        If the  executable  is  located  then  the path to the file is
        displayed.  If the  executable  is not  found  then  move  the
        man.bat file to a directory that appears on $PATH.
