The  following  registry  file  will  configure  your  windows  explorer  so a
"MicroEmacs  Edit" item  appears in the right mouse  button  pop-up menu, this
will open the file in MicroEmacs.

WARNING: this up-dates your Windows registry, this is always dangerous.

I EXCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY  FOR THE USE OF THIS REGISTRY FILE AND THEREFORE AM
NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES  ARISING  FROM THE USE OF THIS. YOU USE THIS
AT YOUR OWN RISK!

The registry file makes the  assumption  that the program  me32.exe is on your
PATH, if this is not the case search and replace  me32.exe  with the  absolute
path to your ME binary. the  command-line  also uses the -o option to only use
one ME  session,  for  this to work the  Client  Server  must be  enable  (see
user-setup),  if this behaviour is not desired then search and replace "-o -c"
with "-c".

Once you have done  this, cut out the  me32.reg  file and save to a  temporary
.reg file, then double click on this file in a windows explorer.
