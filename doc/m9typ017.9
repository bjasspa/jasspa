.SH "MAGIC STRINGS"

\fB#![ \\t]*/.*sh\fR
.\"
\*(mE recognizes the magic string on the first line of the file used to locate
the  executable.  The  shell  files  may  be  extension  less  and  are  still
recognized.  Note that this is the typical  method of identifying  shell files
and will recognize other files not mentioned above i.e. \fBbash\fR shells.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBshell\fR  file type template  provides  simple  hilighting of the shell
files.
.SH BUGS
None reported.
.PP
There is a heavy bias towards Bourne, Korn and Zsh shells. The author is not a
csh shell user so has probably missed a lot of csh features.
