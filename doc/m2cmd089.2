.SH DESCRIPTION
.B name-kbd-macro
labels the last defined keyboard macro with the given  \fIcommand\fR name. The
command  name  must be  either  unique  or the  name of an  existing  macro. A
keyboard  macro is deleted  when another  keyboard  macro is defined, but when
named, it is  preserved. A named  keyboard  macro can also be bound to its own
command  key  sequence,  and may be inserted  into a buffer  enabling it to be
saved and thus re-loaded and re-used at a later date.
