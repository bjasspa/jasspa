.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcharset-change\fR  opens a dialog  allowing the user to select a \fBFrom\fR
and  \fBTo\fR  character  set. If the  \fIConvert\fR  button is  selected  the
current  buffer is  converted to the  destination  character  set. The command
assumes that the current buffer is written in the \fBFrom\fR  character set,
no attempt is made to verify this.
.PP
\fBcharset-iso-to-user\fR  converts the current buffer, assumed to be in \*(sF
font format, to the current user's character set (defined by
.Ht user-setup 3 ).
This process typically corrects any foreign language display problems.
.PP
Conversely,  \fBcharset-user-to-iso\fR  converts  the current  buffer from the
user's character set to \*(sF, this is typically used for the transfer of text
files between different systems.
.PP
The current character set is configured using the
.Ht user-setup 3
dialog (see
.Hl "Display Font Set" user-setup 3 ).
This in turn uses the command
.Ht set-char-mask 2
to create the low level character conversion tables.
.SH NOTES
\fBcharset-change\fR,  \fBcharset-iso-to-user\fR and \fBcharset-user-to-iso\fR
are macros defined in \fClangutl.emf\fR.
