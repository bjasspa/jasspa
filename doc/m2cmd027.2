.SH DESCRIPTION
.B change-font
is a  platform  specific  command  which  allows the  displayable  font to be
modified. The  selection of font is determined by the monitor  resolution  and
the capabilities of the graphics adapter.
.PP
This command is available on all systems except  termcap. While  \s-1MS-DOS\s0
does not  support  the  concept of  different  fonts, it does (or at least the
graphics card does) support the concept of changing screen  resolution,  which
has the effect of changing the font. Each platform takes  different  arguments
and are considered independently, as follows:
.SS "X-Windows"
The X-Windows  \s-1UNIX\s0  environments  accept a single  argument which is a
fully  qualified  font  name.  Simply  give the font X name and the font  will
change if it is  available.  The window size  changes to attempt to retain the
same number of rows and columns so ensure that when  changing to a larger font
then there is enough  room (or a way) to resize a window  which is larger than
the actual screen.
.PP
The X font string  describes the  attributes of the font in terms of it's size
name etc. as follows:-

Where
.IP \fIfoundry\fR
The type of foundry that digitized and supplied the font.
.IP \fIfamily\fR
Font Family.
.IP \fIweight\fR
Modifies the appearance of the font, the \fIweight\fR is usually  \fBmedium\fR
or \fBbold\fR.
.IP \fIslant\fR
Determines  the  orientation of the font.  \fIslant\fR is usually  \fBr\fRoman
(upright), \fBi\fRtalic or \fBo\fRblique.
.IP \fIwidth\fR
Describes  the  proportionate  width  of  the  font.  Typical  widths  include
\fBnormal\fR, \fBcondensed\fR, \fBnarrow\fR, \fBdouble\fR.
.IP \fIpixels\fR
Pixel size of the font
.IP \fIpoint\fR
The resolution of the font in tenths of a \fBdpi\fR (i.e. dpi*10)
.IP \fIhres\fR
Horizontal resolution of the font in dpi.
.IP \fIvres\fR
Vertical resolution of the font in dpi.
.IP \fIspace\fR
The spacing of the font. Typical spacing values include \fBm\fRonospaced (i.e.
fixed width), \fBp\fRroportional and \fBc\fRharacter cell.
.IP \fIav\fR
Mean width of all font characters, measured in tenths of a pixel.
.IP \fIset\fR
Character set - character set standards e.g. \fBiso8859-1\fR.
.LP
The default font used by \*(mE is
.CS
\-*-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-*-*-*-c-90-iso8859-1
.CE
A good font to try is:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
change-font "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-*-*-c-80-iso8859-1"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
The font may also be changed in your  \fB.Xdefaults\fR  file by inserting  the
line:-
.CS
MicroEmacs.font "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-*-*-c-80-iso8859-1"
.CE 0
.SS "IBM-PC / MS-DOS"
\s-1MS-DOS\s0  may only  change the screen  resolution,  the  standard  screen
resolution  is  either  80  columns  by 25  rows or 80 by 50. A more  advanced
graphics card can typically  support up to 132 by 60, MicroEmacs in theory has
no limit but it has only been tested up to this size.
.PP
The main problem with \s-1MS-DOS\s0  machines is that there is no standard and
this is no exception.  The graphics  mode needed to get a 132 by 60 screen (if
available) varies from one card to the next so \*(mE needs to know the graphic
mode number your card uses to get your required screen resolution.
.PP
\*(mE can also  attempt a little  bit of magic to double the number of rows on
the screen for a given  screen  resolution.  This is how 50 lines are obtained
from the  standard  25 line mode 3. If the value of  "\fIspec\fR"  is non-zero
then this is attempted, to the authors  knowledge this will either work or not
depending  on the  direction  of the wind and no harm  will  befall  the users
equipment. However the author also quickly disclaims  anything and everything,
the user uses this at their own peril, like everything else.
.PP
\*(mE  attempts to  determine  the new screen width and depth  itself, in
case this fails the commands
.Ht change-screen-width 2
and
.Ht change-screen-depth 2
may be used to correct the problem.
.PP
Following are the standard \s-1MS-DOS\s0 text modes:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
change-font "2" "0"       ; Simple monochrome or EGA monitor, 80 by 25.
change-font "3" "0"       ; Simple EGA/VGA monitor, again 80 by 25.
change-font "3" "1"       ; Simple EGA/VGA monitor using spec, 80 by 50.
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
Most Trident cards support the following text mode:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
change-font "86" "0"      ; Sweet 132 by 60
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
A Diamond Stealth supports the following mode:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
change-font "85" "1"      ; Nice 132 by 50
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
Cirrus video cards (1MB) seem to support:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
change-font "84" "1"      ; PT-526 (132x50)
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
Time to start digging out your graphics card manual!
.SS "Microsoft Windows"
The Microsoft  Windows  environments  utilize font files to drive the display.
When
.B change-font
is  invoked  with  no  arguments,  or a \-ve  argument  then a font  dialog  is
presented  to the user to allow the font to be  selected.  The current font is
not changed if a \-ve argument is given, in both cases the variable
.Ht $result 5
is set the the user  selected  font. The format of the  returned  string is
"\fCOWwwwwhhhhhFontName\fR", where:-
.IP \fBO\fR
The type of character set (0 for OEM and 1 for ANSI).
.IP \fBW\fR
The font weight (0 - 9).
.IP \fBwwww\fR
The font width.
.IP \fBhhhh\fR
The font height.
.IP \fBFontName\fR
The font name.
.PP
If a +ve argument is specified with
.B change-font
then the arguments are explicitly entered, arguments are defined as follows:-
.IP \fIfont\fR
The name of the font - maximum of 32 characters. Select Fixed mono fonts only.
Proportional  fonts may be  specified  but the cursor  will not align with the
characters on the screen.
.sp
An empty name ("") may be specified  resulting in the selection of the default
system OEM font. No other arguments are required when specified.
.sp
Note that  \fBCourier  New\fR is not  actually  a fixed  mono font as might be
expected.
.IP "\fIcharSet\fR"
The type of character set required, this is an integer value of:-
.RS
.IP
\fC\ \ 0\fR \- ANSI or Western (True Type etc)
.br
\fC161\fR \- Greek
.br
\fC162\fR \- Turkish
.br
\fC204\fR \- Russian
.br
\fC255\fR \- OEM (or bitmapped)
.RE
.IP \fIweight\fR
The weight of the font. The values are defined as:-
.RS
.IP
.nf
\fC0\fR \- Don't care (Automatically selected).
\fC1\fR \- Thin
\fC2\fR \- Extra Light
\fC3\fR \- Light
\fC4\fR \- Normal
\fC5\fR \- Medium
\fC6\fR \- Semi-Bold
\fC7\fR \- Bold
\fC8\fR \- Extra-Bold
\fC9\fR \- Heavy
.fi
.RE
.IP
Note that you may  request a weight and it is not  honored.  Typically 4 and 7
are honored by most font definitions. 4 is typically used.
.IP \fIwidth\fR
The width of the font.  Specifies  the  average  width, in  logical  units, of
characters  in the  requested  font. If this  value is zero,  the font  mapper
chooses a "closest  match" value. The "closest  match" value is  determined by
comparing the absolute values of the difference  between the current  device's
aspect ratio and the digitized aspect ratio of available fonts.
.sp
Note  that if the  width  is  specified  as zero  then the  height  should  be
specified and the width will be automatically selected.
.IP \fIheight\fR
The height of the font. Specifies the desired height, in logical units, of the
requested  font's  character cell or character. (The character height value is
the  character  cell height value minus the  internal-leading  value.) If this
value is  greater  than zero, the font  mapper  matches  it against  available
character  cell  height  values; if this value is zero, the font mapper uses a
default  height value when it searches for a match; if this value is less than
zero, the font mapper matches it against available character height values.
.IP
Note: as with the  weight  the width and height may not be honored if the font
cannot support the specified  width/height in which case the closest  matching
height is automatically selected
.SS "Notes on the Standard Windows Configuration"
For  releases  prior  to  '99,  the   \fBTerminal\fR   font  is  the  standard
\s-1MS-DOS\s0  font used for the  \s-1MS-DOS\s0  window. This is an \s-1OEM\s0
fixed width character set which contains all of the conventional symbols found
in the \s-1DOS\s0 shell.
.PP
Releases of MicroEmacs post '99 may utilise any of the windows fonts, typically
.C "Courier New"
or
.C "Lucida Console"
are used, these provide the best screen rendering of characters.
.C "Lucida Console"
is slightly  better with a smaller font size as this allows a '\fC1\fR'  (one)
and '\fCl\fR' (lower case L) to be distinguished.
.PP
The  \fBTerminal\fR  fonts are the same as shown in the DOS  window the last 2
arguments  are the width x height, the terminal  equivalents  (Bit Mapped) are
commented here.
.IP \fB7x12\fR
Regular weight seems to offer the best resolution for 14/15" monitors.
.IP \fB6x8\fR
Regular  weight is more  suitable  for  17-21"  monitors  which  offer  better
resolutions.
.LP
The best options for the fonts are defined as follows:-
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
;Standard Terminal Fonts - standard weight
;change-font "Terminal" 0 4  4  6
change-font "Terminal" 0 4  6  8
;change-font "Terminal" 0 4  8  8
