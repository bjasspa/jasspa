and
.Ht start-up 3 .
A  number  of  standard  macros  are  provided,  most  of  which  are  invoked
automatically  from the editor itself when  requested by the user. Having said
that, it has not been  unknown for a colleague  of mine to use the editor as a
replacement for a more intelligent
.Hr sed 1
filter, with 12 hours to go and a huge ugly 3-D geometric database to convert,
what  better  way than run it  through  a set of \*(mS  macros to turn it into
another   database  format  that  can  be  handled  -  probably  not  for  the
uninitiated, but that person did pull it off and went home for tea !!

.NH KeyboardBinding - "Keyboard Binding Commands"
.SH "KEYBOARD BINDING COMMANDS"
Keyboard  binding allows key strokes to be associated with commands and macros
such that when a bound key stroke  sequence is recognized  its  associated (or
bound) command is invoked, thereby controlling the editor. A set of
.Hl "Default Bindings" bindings 2
exist for \*(mE which may be altered  using the  binding  commands.  There are
three types of key bindings:
.IP "\fBGlobal\fR"
Associates a key-stroke  with a command for all buffers. Used to establish the
standard keyboard controls i.e. cursor movement, search, replace etc.
.IP "\fBLocal\fR"
Associates  a  key-stroke  with a command for a specified  buffer only, i.e. a
binding local to the buffer. Local  bindings  allow macro  accelerators  to be
bound to keys without  affecting other buffers  containing  different types of
data. Local bindings are used extensively in the buffer hook commands.
.IP "\fBMessage Line\fR"
Associates  a key binding for use on the command line only,  allowing  command
completion to be diverted etc.
.PP
To bind a command to a key, the command and key names must be known, see
.Hl "Command Glossary" CommandGlossary -
for a complete list of commands and
.Hl "Key Names" keyNames 2
for a complete list of key names.
.LP
The binding related commands are defined as follows:
.SS Commands
.Ss

.SS "Alt Key"
The
.B "Alt Key"
has special binding priorities defined as follows:-
.BS
Direct key binding (e.g. \fBA\-b\fR executes
.Hl file-browser file-browser 3 )
.BU
Main menu hot key (e.g. \fBA\-f\fR opens the File menu)
.BU
Meta key binding (e.g. \fBA\-space\fR \-> \fBesc\ space\fR ->
.Hl set-mark set-mark 2 )
.BE
If the  \fCALT\fR  key is to be used  strictly  as the Emacs Meta key then the
bindings for the menu should be over-ridden by \fIDirect Key Bindings\fR  from
the user  configuration  file i.e. to re-map the default MicroEmacs Alt key to
equivalent \fCesc\fR keys then the following keys should be re-bound.
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
global-bind-key forward-word "A-f"      ; Over-ride File menu binding
:                                       ; For all of the other menu items.
:
global-bind-key backward-word "A-b"     ; Over-ride the file browser.
global-bind-key replace-string "A-r"    ; Over-ride tools binding.
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
This creates a higher priority binding which overrides the underlying default.
The commands that are displaced would have to be re-bound to different keys if
required.
.NH Buffers - "Buffer Manipulation Commands"
.SH "BUFFER MANIPULATION COMMANDS"
A buffer is where \*(mE stores text.  Normally text is read from a file and is
visible in an editing

.NH Functions - "Introduction to Variable Functions"
.SH "VARIABLE FUNCTIONS"
Functions can be used to manipulate  variables in various ways. Functions have
in general one, two, or three arguments. These arguments will always be placed
after the function on the current  command  line. For example, if we wanted to
increase the current fill column by two, using \*(mE's
.Ht set-variable 2
(C-x v) command, we would write:
.CS
set-variable $fill-col &add $fill-col 2
    \\            \\      \\       \\     \\____second operand
     \\            \\      \\       \\_________first operand
      \\            \\      \\________________function to execute
       \\            \\______________________variable to set
        \\__________________________________set-variable (C-x v) command
.CE
Functions  always begin with an ampersand  (\fB&\fR)  character,  and are only
significant  to the first 3 characters  after the  ampersand.  Functions  will
normally  expect  one of  three  types of  arguments,  and will  automatically
convert types when needed.
.IP \fB<num>\fR
An ASCII string  of digits  which is interpreted  as a numeric
value.  Any  string which  does not  start with  a digit  or a
minus sign (\-) will be considered zero.
.IP \fB<str>\fR
An arbitrary string of characters.  At the moment, strings are
limited to 128 characters in length.
.IP \fB<log>\fR
A  logical  value  consisting  of  a  non-zero  number  for  \fBTRUE\fR  (e.g.
"\fC1\fR"),  anything  else  is  considered  \fBFALSE\fR  (e.g.  "\fC0\fR"  or
"\fCfoo\fR").  This  differs  from earlier  versions of  MicroEmacs  where the
strings "\fCTRUE\fR" and "\fCFALSE\fR" were used.

The  \fBmodeLine\fR  is the line of text  shown at the  bottom of each
.Hl window Windows -
identifying the window being displayed. The mode line typically contains
the name of the
.Hl buffer Buffers - ,
the file and  operating  mode  associated  with the  buffer  displayed  in the
window. e.g.
.CS
#*-me (BEI) - 250 foo (foo.txt) ----------------

.B Note
that only a sub-set  of the modes are  visible on the mode line, this  reduces
the cluttering of the mode line. Use the
.Ht about 2
command to determine the exact modes that are active.
.PP
The text content and color of the mode line is fully  configurable  and may be
defined in the users start-up script. The currently active buffer is generally
indicated  by the state of the mode line, e.g.  highlighted  color  (typically
red) and/or double line separator  characters  \fB===\fR;  conversely inactive
buffers  are shown in a dull  color  with  single  line  separator  characters

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

.NH Origins - "\*(mE \- Origins"
.SH "ORIGINS"
This version of  MicroEmacs is based on an early  \fIMicroEmacs\fR  release of
3.8 in 1988, the origins of which are unknown,  except to say it was delivered
on a unmarked 5 1/2" floppy disk.
.PP
The  program  was  originally  ported  to a  Motorola  MVME147  UNIX box as an
alternative to \fBvi\fR.  Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as
it constantly  crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the  development
of \*(mE commenced.
.PP
Development  has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole  oblivious
to further developments of the existing \fBMicroEmacs\fR program. This was due
to  no  Internet   access.  It  was  not  until  1996  the  next   version  of
\fBMicroEmacs\fR  and \fBmewin\fR  (Microsoft Windows  (\s-2TM\s0) port of the
same  program) was  downloaded  from the  Internet and  compared. By this time
\*(mE was  radically  different and we were not about to mesh the two together
\- that would be a step backwards.
.PP
Development of \*(mE has been biased towards the UNIX platform, as most of the
early  development  was performed in the \s-1UNIX\s0  domain. The first of the
window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the  implementation  of
the  Microsoft  Windows  port.  Latterly, we have seen the  resurgence  of the
IBM-PC  platform  which is now  commonplace. For the return  port to the DOS
environment,  and  subsequent  development  of the  Microsoft  Windows port, a
\s-1UNIX\s0  like  interface was required. Most existing users could not abide
the primitive editors found on these machines;  Microsoft Windows was an alien
and hostile  environment  when compared with UNIX. Hence, the \*(mE  interface
utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across all platforms.
.PP
For  portability,  \*(mE  utilizes   character   rendering  on  all  platforms
regardless of the window manager. Under  X-Windows and Microsoft  Windows, the
display is still treated as a character  based display, the subtle  difference
is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that the scroll bars, fonts
etc. are not as slick as they  could be,  certainly  under  Microsoft  Windows
\*(mE  looks  positively  primitive!!  Regardless  of the  look, the goal of a
common editor across all working platforms has been achieved!

support macros following various contributions from users.
.BU
Added  \fIFavorites\fR  to the  \fIFile\fR  pull down  menu. This is a simple
mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites list.
.BU
Ground up implementation of the regular  expression pattern matcher, following
licensing problems with the GNU regex. The resultant pattern matcher is now a
little  faster  than GNU regex and is capable of all of the  standard  regular
expression pattern matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that
double  backslashes are required in the character classes  \fC[..]\fR to allow
for escape  sequence  short cuts such as  '\fC\\n\fR'  (newline),  '\fC\\t\fR'
(tab) etc. It was felt that this  compromise  was better  than having to quote
the more obscure search characters.
.BU
Changed the hilighting and indenting syntax to be GNU regex compliant.
.BU
Modified
.Ht compare-windows 2
to ignore white space by default,
.Ht compare-windows-exact 3
performs an exact character for character comparison.
.BU
Enhanced the tags support to handle multiple tags and recursive directory tree
searching.
.BU
Implemented osd-help, a gui front end to the on-line help. Required changes to
the help system which gives macros  access to the on-line help buffer,  needed
for the index and search.
.BU
Over-hauled the hilighting scheme files and editor to support the disabling of
buffer hilighting.
.BU
Many bugs fixed on all  platforms,  in  particular  unix  cutting  and pasting
(crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit delay.
.BU
Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.
.BU
Introduced message line variables @mx and @mxa.
.BU
Added ftp  support  with a new ftp  'file-browser'  interface  to give easy to
use ftp capability.
.BE 0
.IP 2000
.BS 0
Fixed several millennium bugs :)
.BU
Revamped the printing interface to support colors
.BU
Started using
.Hr CVS 1
at last, much better history from now on.
.BU
Got the emain #define's  properly  supported  again so options so \*(mS can be

.Ht file-op 2
command, created better menus in the
.Ht file-browser 3 .
.BU
Added new
.Ht set-position 2
which can be used to store all information about the current window and
.Ht goto-position 2
which will then restore them. Allowed macros to use non-letter  characters for
alpha marks and positions so they no longer need to clobber user ones.
.BU
Greatly  improved  ipipe-shell-command  efficiency on windows by introducing a
new thread approach to listen for activity.  Implemented a shell  command-line
in an ipiped environment so
.Ht ishell 3
command is now usable on Windows platforms.
.BU
Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more rationally.
.BE 0
.IP 2001
.BS 0
Changed buffer  variables to except the form  :<buffer-name>:<variable>,  like
command  variables.  This allows macros to access  variable not defined in the
current buffer.
.BU
Added new
.Ht command-wait 2
command  to  enable  macros  to wait for user  dependent  completion,  used in
\fBgdiff\fR.
.BU
Added support for new
.Ht $buffer-backup 5
variable for setting the back-up file location.
.BU
Major work to enable the complete  rebinding of all keys so the user interface
to \*(mS can be completely  changed, this allows for example a Windows feel to
be created. This  required  many  internal  ghosts to be exorcised and add new
macro functions
.BU
Added new generic buffer setup, menu and help macros, creating the new
.Ht buffer-setup 3
command. Ported all existing file hooks to this new interface greatly reducing
the buffer hook size while increasing its functionality and consistency.

New caps-lock,  num-lock,  scroll-lock and pause key support for win32 & unix.
The *-lock  implementation  to be more like  S-pick and C-pick as the keys are
automatically  supported  (like the  shift) so there are no  default  binds to
void, the keys are only generated if there are bound. Could not implement this
on DOS.
.BU
which command built in i.e. "M-x which". Used for command utilities.

Utilised the latest screen-update improvements to make the gdiff screen update
rock solid.
.BU
mlGetChar fix. The key "return" was the 78th special char, i.e.  SKEY_SPEC|'N'
and as the  mlGetChar did not check the SKEY_SPEC  bits,  pressing  return was
like pressing 'N' so on a Y/N prompt try pressing  return, its like saying No.
.BU
Spelling  dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because of the language
changes,  you need to rename your  personal  dictionary  to  lsdpengb.edf  for
British and lsdpenus.edf for American.
.BU
Hilighting  brackets/braces  as requested  from user base. The hilight  braces
required some other subtle changes to  screen-update  and  show-region and the
addition  of the rbin mode means that this  version is  incompatible  with the
last in quite a few areas.
