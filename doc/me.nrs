\*(mS may be  invoked  from the  command  line to  perform a  specific  set of
filtering tasks, under control of a dedicated start up macro, see
.Ht me 1
and
.Ht start-up 3 .
A  number  of  standard  macros  are  provided,  most  of  which  are  invoked
automatically  from the editor itself when  requested by the user. Having said
that, it has not been  unknown for a colleague  of mine to use the editor as a
replacement for a more intelligent
.Hr sed 1
filter, with 12 hours to go and a huge ugly 3-D geometric database to convert,
what  better  way than run it  through  a set of \*(mS  macros to turn it into
another   database  format  that  can  be  handled  -  probably  not  for  the
uninitiated, but that person did pull it off and went home for tea !!

.NH KeyboardBinding - "Keyboard Binding Commands"
.SH "KEYBOARD BINDING COMMANDS"
Keyboard  binding allows key strokes to be associated with commands and macros
such that when a bound key stroke  sequence is recognized  its  associated (or
bound) command is invoked, thereby controlling the editor. A set of
.Hl "Default Bindings" bindings 2
exist for \*(mS which may be altered  using the  binding  commands.  There are
three types of key bindings:
.IP "\fBGlobal\fR"
Associates a key-stroke  with a command for all buffers. Used to establish the
standard keyboard controls i.e. cursor movement, search, replace etc.
.IP "\fBLocal\fR"
Associates  a  key-stroke  with a command for a specified  buffer only, i.e. a
binding local to the buffer. Local  bindings  allow macro  accelerators  to be
bound to keys without  affecting other buffers  containing  different types of
data. Local bindings are used extensively in the buffer hook commands.
.IP "\fBMessage Line\fR"
Associates  a key binding for use on the command line only,  allowing  command
completion to be diverted etc.
.PP
To bind a command to a key, the command and key names must be known, see
.Hl "Command Glossary" CommandGlossary -
for a complete list of commands and
.Hl "Key Names" keyNames 2
for a complete list of key names.
.LP
The binding related commands are defined as follows:
.SS Commands

.SS "Alt Key"
The
.B "Alt Key"
has special binding priorities defined as follows:-
.BS
Direct key binding (e.g. \fBA\-b\fR executes
.Hl file-browser file-browser 3 )
.BU
Main menu hot key (e.g. \fBA\-f\fR opens the File menu)
.BU
Meta key binding (e.g. \fBA\-space\fR \-> \fBesc\ space\fR ->
.Hl set-mark set-mark 2 )
.BE
If the  \fCALT\fR  key is to be used  strictly  as the Emacs Meta key then the
bindings for the menu should be over-ridden by \fIDirect Key Bindings\fR  from
the user  configuration  file i.e. to re-map the default MicroEmacs Alt key to
equivalent \fCesc\fR keys then the following keys should be re-bound.
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
global-bind-key forward-word "A-f"      ; Over-ride File menu binding
:                                       ; For all of the other menu items.
:
global-bind-key backward-word "A-b"     ; Over-ride the file browser.
global-bind-key replace-string "A-r"    ; Over-ride tools binding.
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
This creates a higher priority binding which overrides the underlying default.
The commands that are displaced would have to be re-bound to different keys if
required.
.NH Buffers - "Buffer Manipulation Commands"
.SH "BUFFER MANIPULATION COMMANDS"
A buffer is where \*(mS stores text.  Normally text is read from a file and is
visible in an editing
.Hl window  Windows - .

.NH Functions - "Introduction to Variable Functions"
.SH "VARIABLE FUNCTIONS"
Functions can be used to manipulate  variables in various ways. Functions have
in general one, two, or three arguments. These arguments will always be placed
after the function on the current  command  line. For example, if we wanted to
increase the current fill column by two, using \*(mS's
.Ht set-variable 2
(C-x v) command, we would write:
.CS
set-variable $fill-col &add $fill-col 2
    \\            \\      \\       \\     \\____second operand
     \\            \\      \\       \\_________first operand
      \\            \\      \\________________function to execute
       \\            \\______________________variable to set
        \\__________________________________set-variable (C-x v) command
.CE
Functions  always begin with an ampersand  (\fB&\fR)  character,  and are only
significant  to the first 3 characters  after the  ampersand.  Functions  will
normally  expect  one of  three  types of  arguments,  and will  automatically
convert types when needed.
.IP \fB<num>\fR
An ASCII string  of digits  which is interpreted  as a numeric
value.  Any  string which  does not  start with  a digit  or a
minus sign (\-) will be considered zero.
.IP \fB<str>\fR
An arbitrary string of characters.  At the moment, strings are
limited to 128 characters in length.
.IP \fB<log>\fR
A  logical  value  consisting  of  a  non-zero  number  for  \fBTRUE\fR  (e.g.
"\fC1\fR"),  anything  else  is  considered  \fBFALSE\fR  (e.g.  "\fC0\fR"  or
"\fCfoo\fR").  This  differs  from earlier  versions of  MicroEmacs  where the
strings "\fCTRUE\fR" and "\fCFALSE\fR" were used.

The  \fBmodeLine\fR  is the line of text  shown at the  bottom of each
.Hl window Windows -
identifying the window being displayed. The mode line typically contains
the name of the
.Hl buffer Buffers - ,
the file and  operating  mode  associated  with the  buffer  displayed  in the
window. e.g.
.CS
#*-me (BEI) - 250 foo (foo.txt) ----------------

.B Note
that only a sub-set  of the modes are  visible on the mode line, this  reduces
the cluttering of the mode line. Use the
.Ht about 2
command to determine the exact modes that are active.
.PP
The text content and color of the mode line is fully  configurable  and may be
defined in the users start-up script. The currently active buffer is generally
indicated  by the state of the mode line, e.g.  highlighted  color  (typically
red) and/or double line separator  characters  \fB===\fR;  conversely inactive
buffers  are shown in a dull  color  with  single  line  separator  characters
\fB---\fR.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

.NH Origins - "\*(mS \- Origins"
.SH "ORIGINS"
This version of  MicroEmacs is based on an early  \fIMicroEmacs\fR  release of
3.8 in 1988, the origins of which are unknown,  except to say it was delivered
on a unmarked 5 1/2" floppy disk.
.PP
The  program  was  originally  ported  to a  Motorola  MVME147  UNIX box as an
alternative to \fBvi\fR.  Reliability of the program proved to be a problem as
it constantly  crashed. In an attempt to rectify the problems the  development
of \*(mS commenced.
.PP
Development  has continued from 1988 through to today, on the whole  oblivious
to further developments of the existing \fBMicroEmacs\fR program. This was due
to  no  Internet   access.  It  was  not  until  1996  the  next   version  of
\fBMicroEmacs\fR  and \fBmewin\fR  (Microsoft Windows  (\s-2TM\s0) port of the
same  program) was  downloaded  from the  Internet and  compared. By this time
\*(mS was  radically  different and we were not about to mesh the two together
\- that would be a step backwards.
.PP
Development of \*(mS has been biased towards the UNIX platform, as most of the
early  development  was performed in the \s-1UNIX\s0  domain. The first of the
window servers was X-Windows, which in turn has shaped the  implementation  of
the  Microsoft  Windows  port.  Latterly, we have seen the  resurgence  of the
IBM-PC  platform  which is now  commonplace. For the return  port to the DOS
environment,  and  subsequent  development  of the  Microsoft  Windows port, a
\s-1UNIX\s0  like  interface was required. Most existing users could not abide
the primitive editors found on these machines;  Microsoft Windows was an alien
and hostile  environment  when compared with UNIX. Hence, the \*(mS  interface
utilizes UNIX style cut and paste across all platforms.
.PP
For  portability,  \*(mS  utilizes   character   rendering  on  all  platforms
regardless of the window manager. Under  X-Windows and Microsoft  Windows, the
display is still treated as a character  based display, the subtle  difference
is that the display pane is re-sizable. This means that the scroll bars, fonts
etc. are not as slick as they  could be,  certainly  under  Microsoft  Windows
\*(mS  looks  positively  primitive!!  Regardless  of the  look, the goal of a
common editor across all working platforms has been achieved!

[051007] Integrated Ric Yeates command line \fB-l <line>:<col>\fR submission -
thanks for the submission.
.BU
[051007] ClearCase. Removed VOB option from \fBcc-state\fR as it did not work.
Made  \fBcc-console\fR read only and better integrated including supporting it
as a toolbar tool (like cvs-console).

[051007] Fixed bad variable assignment in directory list macros.
.BU
[051001] Corrected Sun Solaris x86 makefile to use the Sun Native compiler.
.BU
[050930]  ClearCase.  Fixed  \fBcc-state\fR  to check  the  state of  selected
directories,  which  requires a double  cleartool  call (horrid  command-line)
Added support for  config-spec  viewing and editing. Added  directory  refresh
option for  checkin/out  add etc. Added many  improvements  to cc-state buffer
support,  hilighting, file listing style sorting and selection (i.e. following
are bound \fC1\fR,\fC2\fR,\fC3\fR,\fC+\fR,\fC-\fR,\fCu\fR,\fCa\fR,\fC*\fR)

[050930]  \fBfile-tool\fR,  changed the buffer list  toolbar  tool to keep the
current line to the current buffer when using \fBfind-buffer\fR etc.

[050930] Latest \fIMirkwood\fR update from Bruno.
.BU
[050930] Fixed ftp drag'n'drop copy bug, the source dir needed an file: prefix
to remove the  \fCftp://\fR  of the current  buffer. While test I blew away my
home  directory,  nasty way to  discover  that ftp can return  \fC".."\fR  not
\fC"../"\fR and \fC".."\fR is not ignored when deleting! Fixed.

could implement the required functionality.
.BU
[050920]  Latest  \fIMirkwood\fR  highlight  scheme  - added  underlining  for

[050803]  Fixed \fBne\fR crash when an unbound key is pressed, bug  introduced
with last commits.
.BU
[050721] Fixed  annoying  mouse refocus in osd dialog even though mouse is not
moved - another windows nasty.
.BU
[050720]  File  browser,  added  directory  closing  binding to '\fCc\fR'  and
\'\fC+\fR' \'\fC-\fR' windows compatible bindings.
.BU
[050720] Pop-up menus, shifted the context menu down one line when opened by a
key.
.BU
[050720]  Directory listing. Changed the tag file list macro to support moving
to the  closest  selected  so the user can see which files they are  deleting!
Improved the file-tool so \fC\\\\H\fR will see a hot-key,  '\fC\\\\\fR'  chars
and  '\fC"\fR'  must be quoted (i.e.  '\fC\\\\\\\\\fR'  &  '\fC\\"\fR')  Bound
\'\fCt\fR' to open the file tool menu directly so tools can be easily executed
without use of the mouse.
.BU
[050720]  Source code  reorganisation.  Standardized  the # preprocess  forms,
removed 2 uses of #elif and  cplusplus  and changed odd  '\fCdefined(_BSD)\fR'
style bracketing which the \fBc-hash-eval\fR does not handle.
.BU
[050720] Removed unused functionality from NE. Made the following available as
extended functionality:  \fBbackward-delete-tab\fR,  \fBchange-buffer-name\fR,
\fBchange-file-name\fR,   \fBdefine-macro-file\fR,   \fBdelete-blank-lines\fR,
\fBdelete-some-buffers\fR,  \fBnamed-buffer-mode\fR,  \fBsave-some-buffers\fR,
\fBsave-buffers-exit-emacs\fR,      user(\fC%\fR),     buffer(\fC:\fR)     and
command(\fC.\fR)   variables,    \fB$buffer-input\fR,    \fB$kept-versions\fR,
\fB$mouse*\fR.  \fB$pause-time\fR,  \fB$MEBACKUPPATH\fR. Removed \fB-c\fR from
ne's  help  page as this is not  supported.  Moved  macro  regex  \fB&xseq\fR,
\fB&xrep\fR   based   directives  and  most  \fB@\fR   variables  to  extended
functionality.
.BU
[050719]  Organiser  address  search  broken  due to recent  changes  to macro
argument getting. Fixed by changing the numeric argument which was ambiguously
defined.
.BU
[050718]  Source  code  reorganisation.  Made  the  file  hook  variables  and
HideBuffer  function  statics. Changed ne to use fixed char groups for isUpper
etc   rather   than   the   large   look-up   tables   as  it  does  not  have
\fBset-char-mask\fR to configure them anyway.
.BU
[050718] C template. Fixed and greatly simplified the #if handling in the hash
eval code. Added support for \fC#undef\fR.
.BU
[050715] Source code  organisation.  Removed unused code when there's no ipipe
support.  Hashed out location  functions  which are only required by socket or
ipipe support.
.BU
[050714]   Combined   \fBcc-log\fR   and   \fBcc-annotate\fR   into  a  single
\fBcc-annotate\fR cammon with GUI. Added \fBcc-vtree\fR and \fBcc-explorer\fR.
.BU
[050714] Fixed \fBuser-setup\fR  setting of number of backups and Ignore files
settings.
.BU
[050714]  Fixed  \fBfile-op\fR  copy  so  the  source  file's  attributes  are
preserved  (i.e.  remains  read  only  etc).  Implemented  the  4th  parameter
(attribs) in \fB&stat\ i\fR  Implemented a  \fBfile-op\fR  chmod using arg bit
\fC0x200\fR.
.BU
[050712]  Corrected NE build under Windows,  console build  including  windows
calls.
.BU
[050712]   Directory  listing,  fixed  delete  copy  and  move  prompts,  flag
\fC0x08\fR got changed to \fC0x04\fR in \fBfile-op\fR.
.BU
[050712]  Implemented a proper  ClearCase  context diff by recreating  the old
file from the diff and then calling a real diff program.
.BU
[050712]  Changed the diff hilighting to be just one scheme as a CC diff could
contain a gdiff style for files and diff style for directories.
.BU
[050712] Corrected NE build problem with macro debugging.
.BU
[050711]  Corrected Latex template load error in  \fChklatex.emf\fR  (detected
with \fC$debug=1\fR).
.BU
[050710] Fixed old \fC$debug\fR  interface, found a long forgotton mode 3 (now
4) which simply  prints the current line without  waiting, this broken the new
mode 3.
.BU
[050709] Removed the \fB-d\fR command line option - pointless.
.BU
[050709] Improved the macro command argument handling to get missing arguments
from the user, i.e. having a macro line of: \fBfine-file\fR Works okay.
.BU
[050709] Vastly improved the macro  debugging, the \fB$debug\fR  value of 1 is
now 2, 2 -> 3, a value of 1 now tells the user of any unhandled failures.
.BU
[050709] Fixed the Windows window resizing  behaviour to be a lot more usable.
The window size now  increases  in character  size steps rather than  bouncing
around and the window is refresh as its changed. The Horizontal width limit of
the window has effectively  been removed (set to 400 chars) the depth is still
restricted to the screen size, issue raised by Tom Hundt.
.BU
[050709] Added new file tools interface,  creating  windows explorer type file
name based tools (e.g. extracting a zip file).
.BU
[050709] Added ClearCase \fBcc-log\fR and \fBcc-annotate\fR  (similar to cvs's
commands)
.BU
[050709]  Stopped  the default  file hook from  creating a bogus tool menu and
help page.
.BU
[050709] Fixed the previous-line macro and the kill-word key bindings.
.BU
[050709] Changed the menu items which open a sub dialog to having  '\fC...\fR'
in their name as per the gui standard, issue raised by Tom Hundt.
.BU
[050708]  Changed  sub-menu  display chars, auto open menus are now ' \fC>\fR'
and manual are '\fC+\fR', issue raised by Tom Hundt.
.BU
[050708] Got thoroughly fed up with the emacs style \fBkill-word\fR - useless.
Came up with a  compromise,  if no numeric  arg is given then it works the old
way, if an  argument  is given  (i.e. 1, 2 ...) it works in like emacs  (which
makes sense as you are asking it to kill 1 word etc.)
.BU
[050708] Changed  \fBlist-commands\fR and  \fBcommand-apropros\fR  to not list
hidden macros by default. They can be listed if bit 1 of the numeric  argument
is clear (aka \fBlist-buffers\fR)
.BU
[050625]  Updated  mode line  letter  mnemonics  which were out of date, issue
raised by Tom Hundt.
.BU
[050625]  Stop me crashing  when  describe-variable  is given  something  like
"\fB&or\fR",  now restricted to variables of type \fC#\fR,  \fC$\fR,  \fC%\fR,
\fC:\fR, \fC.\fR only.
.BU
[050618] Added support for -ve offests to \fB&lef\fR,  \fB&mid\fR,  \fB&rig\fR
functions to go from the end of the string.
.BU
[050618]  Created a \fIno wait\fR option to  \fBshell-command\fR  so processes
can be  launched  and  forgotten  about. Also added  support for all the other
process  launch flags present in pipe and ipipe shell  commands.  Removed some
very dead code.
.BU
[050618] Avoided a '\fB&mid -1\fR' in display  matching fence  (\fCdmf.emf\fR)
by restructuring the logic a bit.
.BU
[050616] Revision 3 of ClearCase support.
.BU
[050614]  Second rev of  clearcase  support.  restructured  the  execution  of
cleartool  so ipipes  are used (even  though the user may not be able to edit)
giving feedback on progress.  Implemented a basic diff which can only diff one
file at a time  and  only  with its  predecessor  but at least it  supports  a
context output of sorts!
.BU
[050614]  Fixed  \fBcommand-wait\fR  when no arg is  given  to  return  when a
callback sets the \fC.wait\fR  variable. Command now returns imediately if the
\fC.wait\fR  variable is not defined. Fixed windows sleep  function  which was
managing to break out before it should.
.BU
[050612] latex added macros for bold/italic/mono character formatting.
.BU
[050612] nroff region support for character formating.
.BU
[050612]  \fB.fhook-xxx.command-n\fR  syntax  added  to  \fBbuffer-init\fR  to
simplify comamnd definition.
.BU
[050610]  Removed "\fBC-c C-g\fR" key binding in document  macros and replaced
with "\fBC-c <\fR" because of \fBC-g\fR issue.
.BU
[050610] CVS added support for a \fBcvsco.etf\fR checkin template.
.BU
[050610] First  revision of ClearCase  support, very  incomplete and primative
but the hooks required in the rest of the system are in place.
.BU
[050609] Changed the directory listing so '\fC.\fR' is removed and \fC..\fR is
always  the first  \fIfile\fR  and cannot be  selected.  Fixed some  directory
display annoying refresh issues.
.BU
[050609]  First  implementation  of  directory  deletion,  copying and moving,
including  support for ftp directories  etc. Areas of concern are still copied
file's permissions and to a lesser degree ownership. Also the copies behaviour
with symbolic links, this must be tested further.
.BU
[050609]  Fixed file  permissions  and ftp minor  issues a couple of major ftp
bugs and \fB$file-names\fR working for ftp directories.
.BU
[050609]  Added  new  \fB&stat\fR   "\fCi\fR"  flag  and  argument  bit  4  to
\fBfile-op\fR  to abort on a problem  rather than  prompt, it also  returns an
error code in \fI$result\fR.
.BU
[050609]  Changed  the  kill  word  commands  so have the same  word  boundary
behaviour  as  \fBforward-word\fR  and  Emacs  (was  killing  word  only  then
whitespaces  only etc). Corrected word movement and killing  command's EOB and
BOB error handling.
.BU
[050608] Added new \fBrdiff\fR (recursive diff) command
.BU
[050608] Updated  \fBstring-rectangle\fR  and \fBspace-rectangle\fR to improve
its usability.
.BU
[050608] Updated \fBdescribe-word\fR setup comment.
.BU
[050601] Corrected  \fCne.emf\fR,  broke Window mode in disabling console mode
for \fBne\ -R\fR option change.
.BU
[050601]   Corrected   crash   on   hilight   with   alpha-numerics   of  form
\fC[[:digit:]]\fR when spelt incorrectly.
.BE
.\"
.B "8th Release - May 2005"
.BS
[050508]  JASSPA  MicroEmacs  8th  release - final.  Core and  macro  versions
20050505.
.BU
[050514]  Fixed ftp copy  lock-up  (most  noticable on windows)  caused by the
response  read at the start of a command  also  reading (and  disgarding)  the
finishing  message  so ME  hangs  at  the  end of the  command  waiting  for a
response.
.BU
[050514] Enabled ipipes under cygwin by default.
.BU
[050514] Fixed win32s build.
.BU
[050514] Fixed \fBmecygwin\fR interactive MS-DOS and cygwin BASH shells.
.BU
[050513] Found the UNIX  \fBwaitpid(-1,...)\fR  in the sigchild handler (which
removes any zoombie processes) removes the pipe commands process so the pclose
call cannot get the process's exit code (returns -1).
.BU
[050509] Changed  the name of aix43  make  files to aix4 and sunos 55 and 56
files to a single sunos5 makefile
.BU
[050509] Added support for \fBaix\ v5\fR (tested on aix v5.1)

for python - thanks to Detlef.
.BU
[050505] Base version numbers reset for next release.
.BU
[050429] Added support for keybinding to item-list  column ordering,  function
is  item-list-order  and is bound to 1, 2 and 3 by  default.  Thanks  to Bryan
Schofield for his submission in this area.
.BU
[050429] Spelling - protect '.'s in the word with \\\\.
.BU
[050428] Corrected TCL hilighting w.r.t. comment at end of line - submitted by
Bryan Schofield.
.BU
[050427]  Major  reworking  of main  commands in a directory  listing  buffer.
Implemented  typical  features  found in an OFM  standard  browser  and create
standard  bindings as well as termcap friendly ones. Changed delete binding to
delete files rather than close browser which is now bound to f10.
.BU
[050427] osd - Added  numeric bit 8 on osd-entry arg to put the text above the
entry.
.BU
[050427]  Added C-x k support to browser  mode to kill the buffer,  also added
hook for the file-browser's view file.
.BU
[050427]   Fixed   user-setup  to  use  only  one  value  of   $file-ignore  &
$kept-versions  per  platform  rather  than one for window and one for console
based versions.
.BU
[050427]  Shrunk  the size of the  file-attrib  dialog  to ensure it fits on a
termcap screen.
.BU
[050427] Fixed nasty bug with transpose-line at the end of the buffer swapping
the last line with the first!
.BU
[050427] main.c - Fixed minor compiler warnings.
.BU
[050426] Added a binding for file  completion (any key bound to insert-tab) so
OSD dialogs can do completion (although awkwardly).
.BU
[050423] Fixed wiki edit mode for Russian  keyboards, the 'k' flag key mapping
was breaking things.
.BU
[050423]  Windows - Fixed  windows  Ctrl numeric pad keys, now come through as
C-0 ... C-9 C-* C-+ etc.
.BU

for the submission.
.BU
[050420] TCL - Added more hilight tokens from Detlef.
.BU
[050420] Document macros - fixed cpp->tcl typo - thanks to Detlef for spotting
this.
.BU
[050410] Fixed the -R option for DOS box, cursor same as the foreground  color
which is not ideal!
.BU
[050410] Fixed the SunOS x86 makefile to disabled #pragam warnings under GCC.
.BU
[050409] Release Candidate 2 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC2)
.BU
[050408]  Added flag to the  user-setup  Tools to force the  rereading  of the
current buffer's file, thanks to Bryan Schofield.
.BU
[050408]  Added new  .item-list.width  variable  to allow  control of the item

Nicholas Kudriavtsev
.BU
[050331] Added support for the setting of the history in macros via @h#.
.BU
[050325]  registry.c - removed  compiler  warning  indicating  porting problem
hilighted  under Darwin. Post  increment of variable on left of assignment and
same  variable  appeared  on the  right,  split  out the  increment  to reduce
ambiguity of the statement.
.BU
[050320] UNIX only - add a rule for .dir files found in the X11  directory. We
do not want this files identified as "dir" info root file
.BU
[050320] Added termcap (white) scheme for reverse video operation.
.BU
[050320]  Newuser  registry file - added default entry for Apple Mac "darwin".
Confirmed operation under Mac X-Windows.
.BU
[050320]  Extended  ME exit  commands  to support the  discarding  of modified
buffers '\fC0x8 discard modified buffers\fR' and
.\"
\'\fC0x10 discard modified buffers and create recovery file for changes\fR'.
.BU
[050320]  Corrected  XML  syntax  for  strings  "\fC...\fR"  to fix indent and
hilight anomalies.
.BU
[050319]  Added  \fB-R\fR  command  line  option to reverse the built in video
schemes - specifically for \fBne\fR(1) also works with \fBme\fR(1).
.BU
[050319] Corrected default mode settings. Recent removal of  \fBletter(2m)\fR,
\fBline(2m)\fR  etc. changed the mode byte assignment of some modes. The built
in global mode default was not updated for this change in bytes and  incorrect
global modes  appeared as a result -  specifically  \fBquiet(2m)\fR  which has
jumped bytes.
.BU
[050315] LEX/YACC template - Corrected LEX and YACC  highlighting.  Aligned C,
C++ and YACC/LEX templates to be consistent.

[050315] Added new
.Ht browse 3
command and binding to f3, changed existing  collapse-all  \fBf3\fR binding to
\fBC-f2\fR.
.BU
[050315] Modified  ME exit  commands to support a bitwise arg n where main
.Ht exit-emacs 2
has '\fC0x01  Prompt\fR',
.\"
\'\fC0x02  Save each  buffer/reg/dic (with  prompt if 0x01  set)\fR'
.\"
and '\fC0x04  Prompt  for exit code and exit ME with that code.\fR'
.BU
[050313]  Latex  template  -  Corrected  the   latex-fill-paragraph.  Set  the
fill-mode  to  '\fBl\fR'  rather  than  '\fBL\fR'  because  its a pain when it
selects centre rather than left and messes things up.
.BU
[050311]  Directory  list - changed  column sorting so Modified is sorted most
recent first.
.BU
[050311] Fixed perldb pipe operation.
.BU
[050310] OSD  simplified  the main context menu and moved paste a cvs items in
the directory context menu

.BU
[050310] CVS changed the default setting of the recursive add to off.
.BU
[050310] JASSPA MicroEmacs quick start document released.
.BU
[050309]  Fixed  bug in  regex  multi-line  search  backwards,  searching  for
"\fCfoo[^a]\fR"   is  a  mult-line  as  \fC[^a]\fR  matches   \fC\\\\n\fR,  if
"\fCfoob\fR" exists at the start of the line isearch-backward  refuses to move
on.
.BU
[050309]  Catman  pages  added for ne(1) and me(1)  complaints  with gentoo as
missing. Added to the package builds.
.BU
[050308]  Fixed a nasty bug with ftp connect  dialog when the host has a port.
Changed the default  path to be nothing  which  becomes  \fC/~/\fR to list the
login  directory.  Change the tab order to not include the password as tabbing
through the entry will lose the password, must now access via mouse or hot key
which is not ideal.
.BU
[050308] Added support for relative ftp browsing via new \fCftp://???/~/???\fR
url form. Added file name completion support for ftp
.BU
[050306] Corrected the docmacro \fChttp://\fR regular expression.
.BU
[050306]  Changed  the date  format of the  \fB-V\fR  command  line  option to
include the century, same format as the
.Ht about 2
buffer.
.BU
[050302] HTLP and PHP - fixed
.Ht indent 2
problems.
.BU
[050302]  Perl  template - fixed  indent  problems  caused by not skipping the
\fC=~\fR type regular expressions.
.BU
[050302] TCL template - fixed continuation and comment indent bug.
.BU
[050302] Added support for R/S-plus (.r) files - thanks to Detlef.
.BU
[050225] HTML  template - fixed an indent which was fixed at "\fC2\fR"  rather
than "\fCt\fR" and added comment skipping indent rules
.BU
[050225]
.Ht dos2unix 3f ,
.Ht unix2dos 3f
and
.Ht unix2win 3f
\- Removed use of  \fB&spr\fR  in favor of \fB&cat\fR so  \fCdos2unix\fR  etc.
work in
.Ht ne 1 .
[050225]  Tracing a problem with hilighting a token of the form  "\fCAB*$\fR",
works if there is a '\fCB\fR' but fails if there are no '\fCB\fR's,  i.e. only
matches  "\fCAB+$\fR".  Found that  removing the end of line special case code
fixes the problem. I believe the rest of the code has been  improved to handle
any end-of-line quirks - I hope so!
.BU
[050225]  Removed the  '\fCstart-up\fR'  macro function  compile option so all
versions support this - "\fCne\fR" can now do a "\fC@dos2unix\fR"
.BU
[050225]  Regular  expressions - extended  replacement  string  syntax.  Added
support for  "\fC\\c#\fR"  "\fC\\l#\fR" and "\fC\\u#\fR" to change the case of
groups, where  "\fC\\c#\fR" is capitalise,  "\fC\\l#\fR" is lower "\fC\\u#\fR"
is upper and "\fC#\fR" is the group number (\fC0-9\fR, \fC&\fR)
.BU
[050225] Regular expressions - changed syntax of "\fC\\s?\fR" and "\fC\\S?\fR"
in favor of Perl's simpler  "\fC\\s\fR" and "\fC\\S\fR" for a whitespace  char
class. Added new character classes "\fC\\d\fR" = digits, "\fC\\D\fR" != digits
"\fC\\h\fR"  = hexdigits  "\fC\\H\fR"  !=  hexdigits  "\fC\\l\fR"  = lowercase
"\fC\\L\fR" != lowercase "\fC\\u\fR" = uppercase and "\fC\\U\fR" != uppercase.
These changes were made to both the main regex search engine and the
.Ht hilight 2
token  matching  engine. Added support for char classes  within the main regex
\fC[...]\fR  character class, i.e. now supports regexs like  "\fC[\\l\\u_]\fR"
for any lower, upper or '\fC_\fR'  char. This is not  supported in the hilight
which currently has a more simplistic "\fC[...]\fR" char class support.
.BU
[050225]  Regular  expressions  - changed use of "\fC\\s  \fR",  "\fC\\s-\fR",
"\fC\\S \fR" and  "\fC\\S-\fR"  classes to simply  "\fC\\s\fR" and "\fC\\S\fR"
which is perl regex  compliant  (ditching  Emacs  "\fC\\s\fR"  syntax as it is
cumbersome  and not very  useful).  The only  nasty side  effect is  hilight's
miss-use of  "\fC\\S1\fR" - "\fC\\S9\fR" to mean not "\fC\\1\fR" - "\fC\\9\fR"
group char, changed to "\fC\\!1\fR" - "\fC\\!9\fR"
.BU
[050224]
.Ht ne 1
set to not auto-save or create backups by default.
.BU
[050224]  Added  "\fC-a\fR" and "\fC-B\fR"  command line options to enable and
disable auto-save
.Ht auto 2m
and
.Ht backup 2m
modes.
.BU
[050224] Tcl template - some more fixes to the item list from Detlef
.BU
[050224]
.Ht watch 3
improved   the  refresh  rate  of  a  type  2  or  3  watch  by  ignoring  the
\fC:watch-time\fR and just look at the \fC:watch-size\fR. Fixed the split line
issue with type 2 of 3 watching caused by last line not being complete.
.BU
[050224]  \fBM-x\fR  \fBftp\fR  -  stripped  '\fCftp://\fR'  and any  trailing
\'\fC/\fR'  of the users  entered  host name as these break ftp.  Improved the
dialog's  handling of passwords,  the user can now tell if a password has been
set.
.BU
[050224] Added standard binding for mark-function
.BU
[050224] Fixed the ME token hilighting in the C hook
.BU
[050224] Removed  recently added  \fC%no_backup\fR  variable to disable backup
create as new \fB-B\fR option is a much better way of doing it.
.BU
[050224] \fCedef.h\fR - Removed definition of non-existant variable
.BU
[050224]  Fixed  failure  when  trying to load  "\fChttp://www.jasspa.com\fR",
there is an implicit trailing '\fC/\fR' which \*(mS now adds.
.BU
[050224] Tcl template - major improvement - courtesy of Detlef.
.BU
[050224] Fixed \fBcollapse\fRto  support the file hooks .exact setting (set to
-1 means case insensitive)
.BU
[050224]   Added   new   \fBbeginning-of-function\fR,   \fBend-of-function\fR,
\fBgoto-function-line\fR and \fBmark-function macros\fR - thanks to Detlef.
.BU
[050223]   Windows  MS-dev  6  project  -  corrected   project   settings  for
\fC_URLSUPP\fR  to  \fC_SOCKET\fR  in keeping with the socket dynamic  library
loading.
.BU
[050223] Added exec of wish to the tcl magic hook
.BU
[050223] Fixed
.Ht $window-chars 5
- added OSD default button chars.
.BU
[050222] Fixed
.Ht $user-path 5
being more that 35 chars breaking the
.Ht user-setup 3
dialog.
.BU
[050222]   Directory   listing  -  call   \fCfhook-html\fR   when  file  is  a
\fChttp://\fR file - this is never a directory listing.
.BU
[050222]  Stopped  loading of files in dir listing  when  clicking  way to the
right, must click on the name (\*(mS kept  loading  files when just  trying to
raise the window to the front - annoying).
.BU
[050222] If 0 given  to
.Ht watch 3
call watch-time, this preserves the old interface.
.BU
[050222] Added backup file disabling for
.Ht dos2unix 3f
macros via command line defineable variable.
.BU
[050221]   Changed   the   new   Windows   process   tree   killing   to   use
\fCLoadLibrary()\fR  to detect  whether the OS supports  this  feature (and NT
does not). Also moved the URL support  over to  \fCLoadLibrary()\fR  so we can
remove the \fB-u\fR builds.
.BU
[050220] Added UNIX Shell and Makefile hilighting to
.Ht notes 3 ).
.BU
[050219]  Fixed GNU GCC  warnings in Makefiles  for #pragma in X11 files under
Sun Solaris and uninitialized variables.
.BU
[050219]
.Ht osd 2 .
Removed dialog  '\fCF\fR' flag as it was not documented, did not work and only
used in one obscure  place. Fixed  \fBC-g\fR and \fBDel\fR so they close up to
the  previous  dialog  but does  close  the main  menu  down in one call - was
annoying.
.BU
[050219] Release Candidate 1 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC1)
.BU
[050218]  Corrected  \s-1UNIX\s0
.Hl client-server Client-Server 2
socket file check -- bad test on  existence  of  connection  file, using wrong
variable with wrong test sense.
.BU
[050218] Added site delete button to \fBftp-connect\fR dialog.
.BU
[050218] Fixed  abbreviation  and exec-string  "\fC\\\\p\fR" and "\fC\\\\P\fR"
store and goto  position  problem when the \fCC-x\fR  \fCC-a\fR or \fCC-x\fR a
keys   are   rebound.   Fixed   by   replacing   with    '\fBesc\fR    \fBx\fR
\fBset-alpha-mark\fR  \fBP\fR' (where  \fBesc-x\fR is a safe internal  special
key).
.BU
[050218] Updated
.Ht watch 3
interface and made public. Created new
.Ht watch-time 3
command and prompt user for watch type when no argument is given.
.BU
[050218]  Removed the use of bit \fC0x1000\fR in Ada string hilight as this is
unlikely to be wanted (probably copied from Pascal).
.BU
[050218]  Changed the registry  parser to abort on error rather than trying to
carry on (a very painful process for a badly decrypted registry file).
.BU
[050218] Fixed  highlighting minor issues.
.Ht hilight 2
scheme now returns back
to EOL scheme after a bracket. A branch tag on an \s-1EOL\s0 line
removes the \s-1EOL\s0 flag so it hilights correctly. Branch tag now
supports the \fC0x1000\fR single line hilight. Lookback now supports
\fC0x800\fR on a branch tag.
.BU
[050217]  HTML  highlighting.  Fixed some really  grizzly  scripted  html page
highlighting issues, predominantly with php.
.BU
[050217]  Change ftp so it opens the  \fBftp-connect\fR  dialog if the current
buffer is \fC*ftp-files*\fR.
.BU
[050217]  Fixed ftp dir list  column  detection  and  highlighting  issue with
windows ftp servers (time given as \fC9:15\fR not \fC09:15\fR)
.BU
[050217] Fixed bug in
.Ht set-variable 2
and
.Ht  unset-variable 2
when
.Ht &sprintf 4
is used to create a variable name.
.BU
[050217] Watch command (watch.emf).  Improved the watch command, made '\fC0\fR
\fCwatch\fR'  call  \fBwatch-reset\fR,  changed  \fBwatch-reset\fR  so with an
argument of \fC0\fR it removes all watches  otherwise it resets the main watch
counter and reports to the user which buffers are watched.  Added new '\fC2\fR
\fCwatch\fR'  and '\fC3  watch\fR'  which  compares  the file size,  doing the
following:  \fBa)\fR  file on disk is smaller than last watch - reloads  whole
file. \fBb)\fR file size is the same - does nothing.  \fBc)\fR file on disk is
larger  -  appends   to  the  end  of  the   buffer   the  tail  of  the  file
(\fCfile_size\fR \fC-\fR  \fCwatch_file_size\fR  bytes). This assumes that the
files is always being appended (reasonable  assumption in most cases. The only
difference  between 2 and 3 is that 2 forces a complete  reread of the file on
the first  file  change  (ensuring  the buffer is  correct),  3 does not which
allows the user to trash the first gigabyte of the buffer before  starting the
watch.
.BU
[050217]  Shell  template - added local and function  keywords and fixed a few
string highlighting problems.
.BU
[050216] Made the dir-listing's  (Filtered) label on line 2 pick-able, changing
the filter status when picked Made CVS's CVS-Quick label pick-able doing a full
reread when picked.
.BU
[050216] Fixed a couple of silly register bugs introduced with last
.Ht find-registry 2
concat  root  and  sub-key  change.  Improved  behavior  when ftp erf file is
missing,  now  create a new one in memory  and flags as  changed  so should be
saved on exit.
.BU
[050216]  Do not abort  \fCme.emf\fR  execution  if ftp erf file is missing or
bad.
.BU
[050216]  Fixed by removing the  '\fCstartup\fR'  function,  the main init now
uses dofile  directly and it checks for either a \s-1NULL\s0  or \fC""\fR as a
filname and replaces with  "\fBme\fR" or ("\fBne\fR" and does not complain) if
found to be empty. This means that give
.Ht execute-file 2
an empty string  executes  either  "\fBme\fR" or "\fBne\fR",  i.e. resets me -
nice side effect. Changed  '\fCdofile()\fR'  to  \fCexecFile()\fR  and changed
\fCexecFile()\fR to \fCexecuteFile()\fR (as is function for command
.Hr execute-file 2 )
and change the other exec command function names for consistency.
.BU
[050216]  Fixed an  annoyance  reported by Bruno, ne should not complain if it
fails to find \fCne.emf\fR - fair enough.
.BU
[050215]  Fixed crash  caused by using  \fC-c\fR  option with all files hidden
(comment  when  browsing  ftp dirs as cache dir lists are hidden) The  startup
process  knows the history  created  buffers but the  replacement  was none of
these  and due to the  toolbar  it was a buffer  without a file name and bang!
Fixed in 2 ways, first check the  replacement  has a file name,  second do not
put hidden files into the history - they're hidden.
.BU
[050210]  Improved  movement  between  items  using the  cursor in the  search
dialog.
.BU
[050210] Fixed cvs dialog default settings.
.BU
[050210]   Corrected   search   path   expansion,   incorrectly   handling   a
\fCPATH_CHAR\fR at the start of the string.
.BU
[050209] Up-dated
.Ht user-setup 3
platform  page to new style and added
.Ht yank-rectangle 2
binding.
.BU
[050209] Fixed no-color termcap
.Ht $window-chars 5
variable setting
.BU
[050209] Fixed hot keys (were 3 'U's) in \fCosdmisc.emf\fR.
.BU
[050209] Added new \fIBraceStatement\fR
.Ht indent 2
value to support GNU C indentation style.
.BU
[050209]  Fixed  the  \fCosdDisp()\fR   function  required  a  \fCTTflush()\fR
otherwise the cursor is left in the wrong position on termcap systems.
.BU
[050209] Fixed the default
.Ht $window-chars 5
variable setting.
.BU
[050209] Fixed the DOS home directory setting and compiler warnings.
.BU
[050208] Changed the C indent definition to be the same format as the existing
indent  definitions i.e. uses flag & indent value, this makes it more flexible
and extendible. Updated macro files.
.BU
[050205] Password generation macros added to \fCcontrib\fR directory.
.BU
[050205] Added  JavaDoc  highlighting  to Java  template.  Enablement  via
.Ht buffer-setup 3 .
Removed the existing "\fCmy\fR" extensions from contrib.
.BU
[050205] Added
.Hr Doxygen 1 ,
\fI<stdint.h>\fR and error highlighting to C/C++ templates. Enablement via
.Ht buffer-setup 3 .
Removed the existing "\fCmy\fR" extensions from \fCcontrib\fR.
.BU
[050204] osd - Fixed problems with the
.I "cursor shows current item"
feature of osd caused by the cursor position going outside of the window.
.BU
[050202] Added an initial item number to the favorite and buffer menus.
.BU
[050203]  Standardized  narrow  anchor and line flag movement  behaviors  with
respect to deleting  and  inserting  text.  Enforced to  effectively  exist at
character  column -1 and been strict about  maintaining a protected line. Made
undo cope with  markup  lines that are lost. These  changes may be a little to
severe - we'll see.
.BU
[050202] Fixed \fBC-g\fR close osd dialog crash.
.BU
[050202]  Directory listing - fixed nasty bug cause by the directory  changing
on disk before the hook has managed to do anything leading to a failure - this
has been annoying Jon for some time!
.BU
[050127] \fChkemf.emf\fR - Fixed \fC!until\fR indent rule.
.BU
[050127] First revision of \fBnotes\fR.
.BU
[050127] Fixed  positional  problems with mouse rectangle  regions and added a
mouse rectangle yank to user-setup.
.BU
[050127]  cvs - Set the  initial  osd dialog  item to be the first item rather
than the Okay button (with is still the default button).
.BU
[050127] Fixed \fC*scratch*\fR hook  assignment  issues, initial  startup buffer
and only buffer delete problem.
.BU
[050127]  Added  process  tree killing for windows,  tested on win98, 2k & XP,
would be good to test on win95  (which  should  work) and NT which  should not
work but hopefully will be no worse than current version.
.BU " "
This is a process  tree  killing  for ipipes, in win32  killing the process we
create is simply not good enough, all child processes continue unaffected. For
example, run compile,  kill the buffer in mid compile and it carries on behind
your back!
.BU " "
For Unix we use a new group and kill the group, DOS does not support ipipe. We
could have used the new Job concept in ME but this is only  present in win2000
& XP and the  binaries  are  unlikely  to run on win98 etc. This should run on
every win32 platform  although it is unlikely to do anything positive on an NT
box (works in win2k)
.BU
[050126]  Changed the  location of the  \fBfhook-default\fR  macro so its only
defined if using \fBbuffinit\fR (i.e. if running main \fCme.emf\fR)
.BU
[050126] Fixed osd button repeat issue when current focus is an entry.
.BU
[050126] Changed  \fBinsert-file-name\fR to insert buffer name if a -ve arg is
given, bound to \fBC-x y\fR on the mode line, this replaces ml-lines \fBesc\fR
\fBy\fR feature.
.BU
[050123] Fixed a crash caused by too many closed fences, the recursive  nature
of the  \fCfindfence()\fR  function  triggers a stack crash at around 22000 on
windows. Set limit to 256 nested fences.
.BU
[050122]  Fixed
.Ht dir 2m
mode  loss on a  directory  re-read,  this  caused  a number  of side  effects
including loss of highlighting and user prompt to reload the directory when it
had changed.
.BU
[050119] Removed the "\fIsub-key\fR"  argument  from all registry  related calls
(see
.Ht &reg 4
and
.Ht set-registry 2 ).
The  registry   calls  used  to  comprise  two  arguments   "\fIroot\fR"   and
"\fIsub-key\fR",  the  "\fIsub-key\fR" is really redundant and the same effect
may be achieved by a simple string concatenation of the "\fIsub-key\fR" to the
"\fIroot\fR".
.BU
[050119]  Added  "\fCmy-*hook-always\fR"  macro  checks  in  the  buffer  hook
switching of
.Ht buffer-init 3
to permit  global file hooks to be defined, this allows a file hook to operate
on all buffers.  "\fCmy-*hook-always\fR"  is executed  after the language file
hooks of "\fC*hook-XXX\fR" and "\fCmy-*hook-XXX\fR".
.BU
[050116] Added "\fCTODO\fR" highlighting rule for Makefile comments.
.BU
[050114] Fixed
.Ht narrow-buffer 2
type numeric argument not processed correctly.
.BU
[050113] Added tool bar tool mouse select region command.
.BU
[050113] Added bindings for the cvs and ftp console tools.
.BU
[050113] Fixed
.Ht organizer 3
duplicate index bug.
.BU
[050111] Deleted the
.Hr get-registry 2
command, this has been  depreciated and
.Ht &reg 4
should be used instead.
.BU
[050111] Extended the
.Ht read-registry 2
and
.Ht save-registry 2
commands to permit  reading and writing from a buffer based  registry  (rather
than file).
.BU
[050111] Extended
.Ht list-registry 2
to permit listing of specific nodes, the output buffer of the registry listing
may be specified.  Added a invisible  flag to a registry  node which hides the
node completely (but can be toggled).
.BU
[050111] Fixed windows  server command file polling of up to 60 times a second
by making the adder of the command responsible for 'waking' \*(mS by sending a
\fCWM_USER\fR message. This is not a problem for \s-1UNIX\s0 as it is possible
to wait on file input and \fCEOF\fR is not reported.
.BU
[050105] Fixed several  narrow-to
.Ht narrow-buffer 2
usability issues, with these fixes the top and bottom narrow cannot be removed
without a markup line and the order cannot get muddled.
.BU
[050105] Fixed a problem with the anchor position up-date when inserting a
whole line.
.BU
[050105]  Changed the osd entry mouse handling to always  refocus, this allows
the user to change location in the current entry using the mouse.
.BU
[050105] Fixed.
.Ht insert-macro 2
undo location was incorrect causing a crash.
.BU
[050103]  Spelling  dialog.  Changed  the Ignore  button to  Continue  if word
becomes correct without changing (word added or language changed).
.BU
[050103] Fixed. CVS osd dialog with bad hot-key.
.BU
[050102] Added setting of
.Ht $recent-keys 5
variable.
.BU
[041231] Variable
.Hr $fmatchdelay 5
renamed   to
.Ht $pause-time 5 .
\fI$pause-time\fR  is now used for other  \*(mS  delay  times when the user is
prompted for information.
.BU
[041224] Fixed several usability issues in the search replace dialog.
.BU
[041224] Up-graded printer-setup dialog to new style OSD.
.BU
[041224] CVS dialog - added read-only option to checkout and update.
.BU
[041224] Fixed
.Ht goto-line 2
offset which as always going to the previous line (one out).
.Bu
[041221] Added  support  for proper kill buffer use in message  line, i.e.
.Ht set-mark 2 ,
.Ht kill-region 2 ,
.Ht copy-region 2 ,
.Ht yank 2
and
.Ht  reyank 2
all work in the same way as a normal buffer.
.BU
[041221] Fixed registry node deletion when the node is modified.
.BU
[041221] Removed
.Ht osd 2
\fCosd 0\fR  '\fId\fR'  flag and added  '\fII\fR'  initial  item and '\fID\fR'
default  button flags,  existing osd dialogs  which use '\fId\fR' will fail to
load and need are migrated to use the \fID\fR and \fII\fR flags.
.BU
[041218]
.Ht auto-spell 3
key  bindings  are  promoted to global so its easy to enable in any buffer.
.BU
[041218]  Corrected  setting of the
.Ht $home 5
environment variable to handle MS-Windows  \'\fC\\\\\fR's, auto terminate with
\'\fC/\fR'.
.BU
[041210] Added Enable/Disable Auto-Spell to the context menu.
.BU
[041210] Rearranged the
.Ht organizer 3
dialog to be a little easier to navigate through.
.BU
[041210] Fixed nedit emulation insert binding.
.BU
[041210] Removed
.Hr ml-clear 2
command, replaced with
.Ht ml-write 2
option "\fC0 ml-write\fR".
.BU
[041210] Removed the
.Hr change-directory 2
command, a change in directory is achieved by changing the
.Ht $buffer-fname 5
value such that the path  defines  the  location  of the  command.  All macros
operated  relative to the buffer  location  and never  explicitly  changed the
directory location.
.BU
[041210] Fixed CUA emulation insert binding.
.BU
[041210] Deleted
.Hr letter 2m
mode. Use the default binding of
.Ht forward-delete-char 2
for letter mode off, where single  deleted  characters  are to be added to the
kill buffer then the existing
.Hr letter 2m
mode may be  achieved by binding as "\fC1  forward-delete-char\fR".  Similarly
for backspace,
.Ht backward-delete-char 2 .
.BU
[041210] Deleted
.Hr line 2m
mode. Use a binding with
.Ht kill-line 2
of "\fC1  kill-line\fR"  to mimic the line mode enabled and  "\fCkill-line\fR"
for line mode disabled.
.BU
[041210] Deleted
.Hr cmode 2m .
Electric-c is now configured with
.Ht indent 2 .
C and C++ indent  styles can be different,  can also have a \s-1GNU\s0 C style
etc, can  change  the  indent  width as new indent  rule  supports  '\fIt\fR',
consistent
.Ht $buffer-indent 5
interface.
.BU
[041210]  Created  new osd  file  "\fCosdmisc.emf\fR"  for  miscellaneous  OSD
macros, this removes the OSD  dependency  when the  MicroEmacs  is executed in
special start up modes with startup files. Moved search and new
.Hr indent-setup 3
commands  out  of  "\fCsearch.emf\fR"   and  "\fCformat.emf\fR"   into  a  new
"\fCosdmisc.emf\fR"  as  they  cause  problems  with  utils  that  do not  run
"\fCme.emf\fR" (e.g. "\fCehftools.emf\fR")
.BU
[041210]  Introduced a \s-1GNU\s0  emacs  emulation  mode,  emulation  file is
"\fCmeemacs.emf\fR".
.BU
[041209] Fixed  \fBnewuser\fR  "\fC$user-name.emf\fR"  conflict  issue with an
existing macro (e.g. \fCzaurus.emf\fR) by testing for it and prefixing a digit
to make the file unique.
.BU
[041209] Added \fCesc C-\\\fR binding to
.Ht restyle-buffer 3 .
.BU
[041209] Fixed some issues with the Tools user-setup dialog.
.BU
[041128]  Added MinGW  makefile  posted to JASSPA  group by Patrick  Anderson,
forms part of the release makefiles.
.BU
[041126] Added  '\fCk\fR'  keyboard  setup  to
.Ht set-char-mask 2
which is used to translates foreign keys to a latin char.
.BU
[041126] Changed the internal  \s-1LEADER\s0  byte to \fC0x1c\fR as \fC0xff\fR
is a valid Russian char and it badly breaks \fI$vars\fR and \fImacros\fR.
.BU
[041126]  Fixed  spell  dump word which was not  translating  the words to the
users char-set.
.BU
[041126] Added support for Russian language.
.BU
[041126]   Improved  the  aff  ispell   conversion   routines   (almost  works
automatically).
.BU
[041126] Stopped
.Ht auto-spell 3
from triggering the no dictionaries error, leave it to
.Ht spell-buffer  3
etc.
.BU
[041125]  Fixed  OSD  multi-line   \fCC-k\fR   \fBkill-line\fR   behavior  and
implemented "\fC-1\fR \fCkill-line\fR" support.
.BU
[041125] Added basic support for Verilog programming language.
.BU
[041123] Fixed ftp OSD (auto  entering  entries broke the password  field)
and modernized.
.BU
[041028] Fixed. \fC*find*\fR buffer exhibits the same behavior as \fC*grep*\fR
buffer. i.e. the \fC*find*\fR  buffer remains on screen and a pop-up window is
used to show the file.
.BU
[041028]  Fixed.  \fC*grep*\fR  buffer does not load file when  selected  with
\fC<RETURN>\fR.
.BU
[041027] Spruced up old  "\fCapache.conf\fR"  highlighting  rules and added to
release.
.BU
[041022] Fixed very obscure cvs load-up bug.
.BU
[041122]  Updated  schemes to set '\fIShow  cursor in osd\fR'  suitably and to
make  sure  the  cursor  is not red as this  conflicts  with the  match  fence
display.
.BU
[041120] Fixed
.Ht transpose-lines 2
crash when
.Ht undo 2m
mode is disabled.
.BU
[041120]   Removed  the  OSD   explicit  tab  order  value  as  this  was  not
constructively used and causes many item order problems.
.BU
[041119] Many improvements to OSD dialog user interface following  suggestions
for news  group.  Updated  most of the osd  dialogs  to use the new  \fC[*]\fR
check-box   chars.  Fixed  tabbing   orders  and  moved  some  items  over  to
combo-boxes.  Added  osd-cursor  visibility  support to scheme-edit.  Made the
displaying of the cursor in an osd dialog a
.Ht $system 5
bit set by the highlight scheme and fixed the position when in a child dialog.
.BU
[041118] Added a macro  recursion  depth limit of 20 to avoid blowing up \*(mS
when the user has created an infinitely recursive macro.
.BU
[041112] Added Paul Boekholt's suggested GNU Emacs key bindings.
.BU
[041107]
.Ht kill-paragraph 2 ,
.Ht fill-paragraph 2 ,
.Ht forward-paragraph 2
and
.Ht backward-paragraph 2
commands redefined. \fBkill-paragraph\fR now kills forward and backward rather
than control the kill buffer.  Paragraph  movement now defined  blank-line  to
blank-line rather than the first/last paragraph line.
.BU
[041105] Fixed
.Ht kill-line 2 ,
.Ht forward-kill-word 2
and
.Ht backward-kill-word 2
numerical argument implementation.
.BU
[041104] Removed
.Hr regex-forward 3
and
.Hr regex-backward 3
macros and moved uses of them over to
.Ht search-buffer 2 .
.BU
[041104] Added
.Ht search-buffer 2
command which replaces the macro commands
.Hr regex-forward 3
and
.Hr regex-backward 3 .
Simplifies macro processing of searching by providing a search that explicitly
sets the
.Ht exact 2m
and
.Ht magic 2m
modes. The  default is to respect  buffers  exact and magic mode and flags must
have \fCE\fR or \fCM\fR to ensure they are disabled.
.BU
[041104] Changed any use of
.Ht kill-line 2
to "\fC1\fR  \fCkill-line\fR" as this should maintain its required behavior. A
\fBkill-line\fR  with no  numeric  argument  kills  to the end of the line but
excludes  the end of line  character  (\s-1GNU\s0  Emacs  compatibility).  The
default  binding is the  "\fC1\fR  \fCkill-line\fR"  form,  re-bind the key to
"\fCkill-line\fR" if the end of line is not to be killed.
.BU
[041104] Removed
.Hr line 2m
and
.Hr letter 2m
buffer modes as these can be done using  numerical  arguments to bindings. See
the the
.Ht kill-line 2
binding which   replaces   \fIline\fR  mode.  See
.Ht forward-delete-char 2
and
.Ht backward-delete-char 2
binding which replaces \fIletter\fR mode.
.BU
[041104] Changed the
.Ht forward-kill-word 2
and
.Ht backward-kill-word 2
commands to be more  consistent with \s-1GNU\s0 Emacs.
.BU
[041102] Moved winterm over to using \fCaddKeyToBufferOnce()\fR for mouse move
and time, also done same for \s-1UNIX\s0  mouse time event. This minimizes the
number of mouse moved events that are processed by the system.
.BU
[041101] MS Windows. Fixed mouse cursor disappearing after using a \fIShift\fR
or \fIControl\fR mouse button event.
.BU
[041101] Auto reload the directory even if it is changed (\fChkdirlst.emf\fR).
.BU
[041030] MS-Windows. Removed the "\fCWM_INPUTLANGCHANGE\fR" message handler as
this did the wrong thing (use  \fCAlt-Shift\fR to change between two different
keyboards e.g. US and Russian)
.BU
[041030] MS-Windows. Changed the method used to get the \s-1APPDATA\s0 path to
use \fCSHGetSpecialFolderLocation()\fR as this is available in all versions of
Windows.
.BU
[041030]  \s-1UNIX\s0.  Fixed  the mouse  movement  which  caused a  rendering
anomaly.  Mouse moved  commands are only added to the key buffer if the key is
not  already  present in the key queue. This  alleviates  a large  build up of
redundant    mouse    move    keys    on   the    queue.    (Added    function
\fCaddKeyToBufferOnce()\fR),
.BU
[041030] Added mouse rectangle  region selection  methods,
.Ht copy-rectangle 3
and
.Ht kill-rectangle 2 .
.BU
[041029] Hardened
.Ht cpp 9
C++  commenting  on  \fC//\fR  alignment  when  the  previous  line is a solid
\fC//////////\fR when re-styling buffer.
.BU
[041029] Fixed
.Ht find 3
"\fC*find*\fR"  buffer  operation so that it operates like  "\fC*grep*\fR"  on
file selection.  Keyboard file section enabled within the  "\fC*grep*\fR"  and
"\fC*find*\fR" buffer.
.BU
[041026] Spruced up old  "\fCsmb.conf\fR"  highlighting rules, brought them up
to date with latest keywords and added to release.
.BU
[041026] Fixed
.Hr indent-setup 3
osd dialog.
.BU
[041024] Macro/source  compatibility  macro and source versions updated to
"\fC20041001\fR".
.BU
[041024] Fixed the
.Ht cvs-diff 3
options, local with \s-1HEAD\s0 was not correct.
.BU
[041024]
.Ht latex 9
template extended. Buffer bindings for underscore and quote keys. Search tools
to determine current context.
.BU
[041023] Extended  the  buffer  setup for the
.Ht indent 2
mechanism.   May  now   specify  the  default   buffer   \fIindent-width\fRand
\fItabsize\fR in the
.Ht buffer-setup 3
dialog.
.BU
[041022] Revised  indentation  implementation. The templates now define indent
width independent rules. The
.Ht indent 2
command \'\fIindent\fR' parameter may be defined as an absolute indentation or
using a  \'\fCt\fR'  notation.  The syntax is  "\fC[-][[indent][/indent]]t\fR"
which  defines a vulgar  fraction of \'\fCt\fR'  which is the indent width (or
tabsize) as specified by
.Ht $buffer-indent-width 5
defined below.
.BU " "
The global variables
.Hr $tabsize 5
renamed
.Ht $indent-width 5
and controls the global indentation size.
.Hr $tabwidth 5
renamed
.Ht $tab-width 5
and controls the display size of a literal \s-1TAB\s0 character.
.BU " "
The indentation is now specified on a buffer basis, the variables
.Ht $buffer-indent-width 5
and
.Ht $buffer-tab-width 5
define the
indentation and \s-1TAB\s0 width on a per buffer basis. These are seeded
from the aforementioned global variables.
.BU

allow next and previous tag to be matched. The XML  utilities are also used by
SGML.
.BU

reserved fields to sort. \fCBACKSPACE\fR now moves up a directory level.
.BU
[040322] Changed the interface to \fBcvs\fR, \fBftp\fR and  \fBfile-browser\fR
command so that if a numeric  argument of \fC0\fR is given then the  directory
tree window is not opened, just the \fC*files*\fR buffer.

.BU
[040310] Fix to graphical diff \-
.Ht gdiff 3 .
Occasions  where all changes had been  accepted  and the changes  could not be
saved. gdiff incorrectly prompted user to accept all changes first.
.BU
[040310]  Support for multiple  comment styles in the same language  template.
Additional comment styles are defined in the  "\fChkXXX.emf\fR"  file with the
syntax "\fC.fhook-XXX.comment-N\fR" where "\fCN\fR" is an integer starting for
\fI1\fR to \fIn\fR, the number of different  comment styles. Templates updated
to use multiple comment styles where appropriate (C, C++ and SQL).
.BU
[040310] Support the '\fIr\fR' flag in "\fC.fhook-XXX.comment\fR"  flag field.
Causes the key  binding to  "\fCesc-o\fR"  and  "\fCesc-q\fR"  to restyle  the
comment. All templates updated to include the flag where appropriate.

includes  additional  flag to run in "\fIraw  mode\fR" where the buffer is not
annotated and wrap is disabled.  Additional argument added to command to allow
the
.Ht $buffer-ipipe 5
macro to be defined when the pipe is defined. Corrected operation of
.Ht pipe-shell-command 2
where \fIipipe\fR  automatically  degrades to a \fIpipe\fR  (Windows only), if
degraded then the

\fC2>&1\fR which works on cmd & 4nt but breaks 4Dos and command.
.BU
[040216] Fixed   bottom   Toolbar   window   grows  when  CVS  is  opened,

.BU
[040210]  Fixed  toolbar  Directory  File List does not contain  "\fC../\fR" -
\s-1UNIX\s0 only.
.BU
[040210] Fixed. On UNIX only the
.Ht $progname 5
may not be fully expanded (has just "me") which may lead to a ctags generation
error and an alternate fix to
.Ht $search-path 5 .
.BU
[040210] Fixed. On \s-1UNIX\s0,
.Ht find-file 2
of a symbolic  link which points to a directory  results in a bad dir listing.
The list of files is correct but the  statistics are all wrong (found on SunOS
5.8).
.BU
[040210]  Fix  subtle  ftp bug with  alias ftp  addressed.  Create an ftp site
"\fCftp://test/\fR"  say with user name foo and  password bar and then load in
"\fCftp://test/dir1/\fR"   the   buffer   file  name  is   correctly   set  as
"\fCftp://test/dir1/\fR"  but  the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line  is set to
"\fCftp://foo@test/dir1/\fR".  Firstly the user may wish the '\fIfoo\fR' to be
hidden  but  secondly  with  the  introduction  of being  able to click on the
\'\fIDirectory\fR  \fIlisting  of:\fR'  line  this  has  introduced  a  subtle
inefficiency/bug,   if  I  click  on  the   '\fCfoo@test\fR'   ME  will   load
"\fCftp://foo@test/\fR"  not  "\fCftp://test/\fR"  which to ME is a completely
different  file. This can in turn lead to  "\fCftp://foo@test/dir1/\fR"  being
loaded so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being  loaded!  The fix is
to  make   the   '\fIDirectory   listing   of:\fR'   line   the   same,   i.e.
"\fCftp://test/dir1/\fR"
.BU
[040208]  Fixed.  "\fB-n\fR"  command line option to a console  build causes a
option failure and the executable does not run.
.BU
[040208]  Corrected  \s-1UNIX\s0  jasspa tree search when executable is in CWD
and there is no executable path.

.BU
[040203]  "\fIuser-setup\fR"  changed  name to  "\fIRebind  Home  Keys\fR" for

variable to define the CVS command.
.BU
[040203] XML template extended to include javascript.
.BU
[040130] 2nd iteration of prototype and near final revision of new user setup.
.BU " "
Following  an internal  review of RC3 then it has been  decided to address the
issues  of user  configuration  prior  to a full  release.  This  specifically
addresses the location of user MicroEmacs configuration directories and search
paths. User  configuration has traditionally  required the setting of external
environment  variables  such as "$MEPATH" and for the user to create a private
directory to store user settings. This is proving  difficult for new users who
just want to run the editor. RC4 and  subsequent  releases  will address these
problems by  determining  the correct  location  for  configuration  files and
create the appropriate files and directories under user control.
.BU " "
The net result of these changes should significantly simplify installation and
setup as follows:
.BU "-"
All  platforms  will be able to run  without  any  manual  user  setup  or the
requirement for specific MicroEmacs environment variables.
.BU "-"
User defined  directories and configuration files will be created under editor
control on detecting a new user.
.BU "-"
Existing  installations using \fC$MEPATH\fR will be backwards  compatible with
the new build.
.BU "-"
All  platforms  now  support a searching  jasspa  sub-directory  structure  of
\fBcompany\fR / \fBspelling\fR / \fBmacros\fR. This was traditionally  limited
to the Windows  Install Shield  installation  but has been extended across all
platforms.
.BU "-"
Two new  environment  variables are provided for user or system  administrator
use.
.Ht $MEINSTALLPATH 5
defines the location of the MicroEmacs standard macros and allows the built in
search path to be overridden.
.Ht $MEUSERPATH 5
defines the location of the user private  configuration  directory  and allows
the user to  locate  their  private  directory  in  different  location.  In a
standard install neither of these variables will be required.
.BU "-"
The Microsoft  Windows system defined  application  path will be used for user
configuration   files.  This  is  applicable   for  roaming  users  where  the
application directory is stored on a server.
.BU "-"
The use of the
.Ht me32.ini 8
file  on  MicroSoft  Windows  environments  is  not  required,  but  is  still
supported.
.BU "-"
The \s-1UNIX\s0 path searching is improved.  \fC/usr/local/microemacs\fR  will
be  depreciated  and replaced with  \fC/usr/local/jasspa\fR  in addition other
standard path locations are supported on a per-platform basis.
.BU "-"
On  \s-1UNIX\s0  then the  directory  \fC~/.jasspa\fR  shall  contain the user
configuration   files.  Optionally  the  \fBcompany\fR,   \fBspelling\fR   and
\fBmacros\fR sub-directories may be included in this directory where access to
the system directory locations by the user is not permitted.
.BU "-"
Concept of guest has been removed. \fCguest.emf\fR and \fCguest.erf\fR removed
replaced with \fInewuser\fR.
.Ht user-setup 3
no longer supports setting of name.
.BU "-"
Internal variables
.Ht $user-name 5
and
.Ht $user-path 5
are defined.

.BU
[011016] New caps-lock, num-lock,  scroll-lock and pause key support for win32
& unix. The "*-lock"  implementation  to be more like "S-pick" and "C-pick" as
the keys are automatically  supported (like the shift) so there are no default
binds to void, the keys are only  generated  if there  are  bound.  Could  not
implement this on MS-DOS.
.BU
[011016] which command built in i.e. "M-x which". Used for command utilities.

screen update rock solid.
.BU
[011025]  mlGetChar  fix. The key  "return"  was the 78th  special  char, i.e.
"SKEY_SPEC"|'N'  and as the  mlGetChar  did not  check the  "SKEY_SPEC"  bits,
pressing  return  was like  pressing  'N' so on a "Y/N"  prompt  try  pressing
return, its like saying No! .
.BU
[011016] Spelling  dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because of the
language changes, you need to rename your personal  dictionary to lsdpengb.edf
for British and lsdpenus.edf for American.
.BU
[011016]  Highlighting  brackets/braces  as  requested  from  user  base.  The
highlight  braces  required  some other subtle  changes to  screen-update  and
show-region  and the  addition  of the "rbin" mode means that this  version is
incompatible with the last in quite a few areas.
.BU
[011016]  Fixed mouse handler  (turns out that if the pick event was lost (use
"@cg" or an error) then me would lock!).
.BU

tab behavior).
.BU
[011016] C++ name space indentation support.

[991101] Ground up implementation of the regular  expression  pattern matcher,
following licensing problems with the GNU regex. The resultant pattern matcher
is now a little  faster  than GNU regex and is capable of all of the  standard
regular  expression pattern matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU
in that double backslashes are required in the character classes [..] to allow
for escape  sequence  short cuts such as '\\n'  (newline), '\\t' (tab) etc. It

search characters.
