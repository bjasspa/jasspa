.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.I n
.B compile 
"\fIcompile-command\fR"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B compile
gets and executes the compile command using a pipe execution (incremental pipe
on UNIX platforms), loading the output into a buffer called "\fB*compile*\fR",
with go to error parsing using the command
.Ht get-next-line 2 .
The  default compile execution is set  by variable
.Ht %compile-com 5 ,
the error parsing  is setup using
the command
.Ht add-next-line 2 .
.PP
Before the compile command is executed
.Ht save-some-buffers 2
is executed to allow the user to ensure that all  relevant  buffers are saved.
If an argument is given to compile then it is passed on to this command, so if
an argument of 0 is given, all buffers are automatically saved.
.PP
By default  the output  lines in the window  wrap,  wrapping  may be  disabled
during compilations by redefining the wrap mode as follows. Create the file 
\fCmyipipe.emf\fR to redefine the behavior and add the following lines:-
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
; Macro to redefine the wrapping behavior of the *compile* buffer
0 define-macro my-fhook-ipipe
    !if &seq $buffer-bname "*compile*"
        -1 buffer-mode "wrap"
    !endif
!emacro
.CE 0
.Me $ehf-scheme
.SH NOTES
\fBcompile\fR is a macro defined in \fCtools.emf\fR.
