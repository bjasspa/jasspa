.B read-session
[ "\fIsession-file\fR" ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B read-session
reads in a \*(mE  session file, setting the current  session  information.  If
argument  \fBn\fR is not given then the given  "\fIsession-file\fR"  is simply
read in. If a non-zero  argument is specified  then default  session is set to
the given file-name and the file is read. If an argument of zero is given then
the  default  session is  re-read.  Information  read in (and saved)  from the
history file includes:-
.BS
Searching and replacing history.
.BU
Buffer name history.
.BU
Command name history.
.BU
File name history.
.BU
General (all the rest) history.
.BU
Buffer and file list with line numbers.
.BE
\*(mE's  environment  may be retained  almost intact by the use of the default
session and using the \fB-c\fR (continue)  command-line  option to re-load all
files that were being edited in a previous session.
.PP
On  loading  a new  session  then  the user is  prompted  to save the  current
session.  If the  numeric  argument  is zero (bit 0 is 0) then the user is not
prompted and the  \fIsession-file\fR is effectively loaded and merged into the
current session.
.SH NOTES
When running  multiple \*(mE sessions on the same  work-station  (or different
workstations  sharing the same home  directory), the default  history is saved
when \*(mE exits. As a result the last \*(mE sessions that  terminates  writes
the history information used next time.
.PP
The session information is saved in a registry format file (see
.Ht esf 8 ).
Reference should be made to the notes included in
.Ht erf 8
as to how the  history  file may be  edited  and  effected  in the same  \*(mE
session.
