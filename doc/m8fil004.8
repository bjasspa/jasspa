.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(mE   registry  files  are  ASCII  text  files,  given  the  file  extension
\fB.erf\fR.   The   registry   file  is  a  simple   syntax   that  allows  an
\fIidentifier\fR  to be associated with a \fIstring\fR. The  \fIidentifiers\fR
are  unique  and allow a  \fIstring\fR  value to be found  when a search for a
\fIidentifier\fR is made. The \fIstring\fR component is optional.
.PP
The syntax allows the \fIidentifier\fR's to be hierarchically nested, children
of the  \fIidentifier\fR  node are  enclosed in a set of curly braces  \fB{\fR
\... \fB}\fR. The enclosure  itself  comprises a number of  \fIidentifiers\fR,
which may have their own enclosures, and so on.
.PP
The  backslash  character  `\fC\\\fR' is the escape  character,  the following
sequences of escape character are recognized:-
.IP
\fC\\\\\fR \- Literal backslash
.br
\fC\\"\fR \- Double quote (used within a quoted string)
.br
\fC\\n\fR \- New line character.
.br
\fC\\t\fR \- Tab character.
.PP
The semi-colon  character  `\fC;\fR'  introduces a comment which exists to the
end of the line.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example of a registry file:-
.CS
; -!- erf -!-
; Comment on this line
"dos"
{
    "file-ignore" = "~ ./ .o"
    "font" = "85"
    "mail-dir" = "c:/mail/"
    "mail-send" = "echo from \\"%f\\" file \\"%o\\""
    "mail-src" = "c:/mail/jon"
    "nested"="value"
    {
        "foo"="bar"
    }
}
.CE
The  history  file  \fIusername.erf\fR  is a good  example  of the  use of the
registry.  This file retains  historical  session  information  in The history
registry file is  automatically  written at the end of a editing  session when
the editor is closed down (or may be saved explicitly using
.Ht save-history 2 ).
.PP
Every user should have their own personal history file in their personal \*(mS
directory. The history file is located from the \*(mE search path defined by
.Ht $MEPATH 5 ,
and is named by the environment variable
.Ht $LOGNAME 5 .
.SH NOTES
.BS
The registry files are not currently written with a backup.
.BU
Special care should be taken when editing  registry files when they are loaded
into  MicroEmacs. It is recommended  that the registry file is not loaded as a
registry item when editing the registry text file.
.BE
To edit  the  history  registry  file  within  MicroEmacs  then the  following
sequence of steps should be followed:-
