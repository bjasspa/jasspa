.SH DESCRIPTION
.B save-some-buffers
cycles through all visible buffers (buffers without mode
.Ht hide 2m
set) and attempts to save all modified  ones, writing the contents back to the
file from where it was read. For each buffer that has been  modified  the user
is  prompted  to save the buffer, a value of \fBy\fR  initiates a save for the
buffer, \fBn\fR skips the buffer.
.PP
The  argument  \fIn\fR  can  be  used  to  change  the  default  behavior  of
save-some-buffers described above, \fIn\fR is a bit based flag where:-
.IP \fB0x01\fR
Enables the user prompt before the buffer is saved  (default). If this flag is
not supplied then all modified visible buffers will be written.
