.XI expand-look-back - "Complete a word by looking back for a similar word"
.SH NAME
expand-look-back \- Complete a word by looking back for a similar word
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B expand-look-back
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B expand-look-back
attempts to complete the word at the current  position by looking backward for
another  word which  starts the same. If such a word is found within 100 lines
of the current cursor  position the current  partial word is replaced with the
word found.
.PP
.B expand-look-back
is automatically invoked from the
.Ht expand-abbrev-handle 3
macro in  response  to an  expansion  command,  it is only  invoked if enabled
in the 
.Ht user-setup 3
=> General => Abbrev Expansion => Lookbk setting is enabled.
.SH NOTES
.B expand-look-back
is a macro implemented in \fCabbrev.emf\fR.
.PP
The \fBuser-setup\fR configuration simply sets the macro
variable  \fC.expand-look-back.on\fR  to TRUE, i.e.:
.Me emf-scheme
.CS
set-variable .expand-look-back.on 1
.CE
.Me ehf-scheme
It may be subsequently disabled by setting the variable back to 0.
