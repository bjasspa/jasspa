.SH DESCRIPTION
.B list-commands
constructs a list of all known built in commands and macros that are currently
defined  by  \*(mE  and  presents  a list  of  those  commands  in the  buffer
"\fB*commands*\fR". Each entry is formatted as:-
.IP
.B "command ......................... keyCode"
.LP
Where  multiple  keys  are  bound  to  the  same  command,  then  each  of the
\fIkeyCode\fR's is shown.
.PP
.B list-commands 
only displays  visible  commands, if a numeric  argument \fIn\fR of 0 is given
then all commands are displayed, irrespective of their hidden status.
.PP
.B list-commands
is similar to
.Ht describe-bindings 2
except that the commands are  presented in  alphabetical  order (as opposed to
key binding order).
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example of the output of \fBlist-commands\fR:-
.CS
