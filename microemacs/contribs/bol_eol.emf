; Smart beginning of line
; Moves cursor at first non-white-space character at the beginning of the
; current line. If the cursor is already there or lies within the leading
; whitespace it will be moved to the beginning of line.
;
; If the numeric argument is specified as 0 then the cursor position is
; toggled between column 0 the actual line beginning and the first non-white
; space chatracter. If a non-zero argument is given then the cursor remains
; at the beginning of the line.
