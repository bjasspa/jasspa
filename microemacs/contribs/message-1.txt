Bloody typical, just as we are about to release someone makes a submission! I
think this is too late, what are your thoughts (I've not had chance to go
through it).

Hi,
In the attached file there are two patches for jasspa microemacs wich adds
support for spanish keyboard under Unix
Both were generated with diff -Naur orig_src_directory modif_src_directory

patch.0212 :    patch to jasspa microemacs from December 2002
patch.040206 :  patch to jasspa microemacs Februray 2004 RC4

These patches have only been tested under Linux ( 2.4.18 & 2.6.4 with
xfree86 4.3.0.1-1 ) on my own computer so they may not work on other
systems, although i think it would be trivial to make them work in any
other Unix-like systems.

They enable you to enter accented characters by pressing the
corresponding accent key and after releasing it, pressing the
letter ( so the keypresses ^ A would generate A^ ).
Also adds suport for entering directly letters such as N~ or C,.

The patch.040206 patch also fixes a strange behavior with the AltGr key
wich didn't occur on the December 2002 version. When pressing the
AlGr key, it's interpreted as C-c, so for entering for exmple an "@" you 
must
press AltGr and without releasing it  press twice the "@" key.

The build script has also been patched adding one more commandline option
( -e ) wich build mecw with support for spanish keyboard.

The files hkmodula2.emf and modula2.etf are respectively the syntax
definition and a template for the programming language Modula-2.
These have only been tested with jasspa microemacs from December 2002.

Thanks for making one fo the best editors i've ever seen and
excuse my bad english ( I'm spanish )

Regards

Alberto Hernandez Arenaz
