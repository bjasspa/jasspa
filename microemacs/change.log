7th Release - February 2004

    [040206] RC4 - Release Candidate 4 - MicroEmacs '04

    [040204] Re-worked Microsoft Windows "me32.ini" file specification.  Order
             revised and lookup simplified.

    [040203] "user-setup"  changed name to "Rebind Home Keys" for rebinding of
             home and end keys to  start/end  of line.  Removed  "C-v" binding
             that existed with old "MS keys" label.

    [040203] Reworked all user defined defined  directory save locations, ftp,
             spell, etc..

    [040203] Corrected osf1, openBSD and zaraus emf files.

    [040203] Added "%cvs-com" variable to define the CVS command.

    [040203] XML template extended to include javascript.

    [040130] 2nd  iteration of prototype  and near final  revision of new user
             setup.

             Following  an internal  review of RC3 then it has been decided to
             address the issues of user configuration prior to a full release.
             This  specifically  addresses  the  location  of user  MicroEmacs
             configuration  directories  and search paths. User  configuration
             has  traditionally  required the setting of external  environment
             variables  such as "$MEPATH" and for the user to create a private
             directory to store user  settings. This is proving  difficult for
             new  users who just want to run the  editor.  RC4 and  subsequent
             releases will address these  problems by determining  the correct
             location for configuration files and create the appropriate files
             and directories under user control.

             The net result of these  changes  should  significantly  simplify
             installation and setup as follows:

             * All platforms will be able to run without any manual user setup
               or  the   requirement  for  specific   MicroEmacs   environment
               variables.

             * User  defined  directories  and  configuration  files  will  be
               created under editor control on detecting a new user.

             * Existing   installations   using   $MEPATH  will  be  backwards
               compatible with the new build.

             * All  platforms  now  support a searching  jasspa  sub-directory
               structure   of   company  /   spelling   /  macros.   This  was
               traditionally   limited   to   the   Windows   Install   Shield
               installation but has been extended across all platforms.

             * Two new  environment  variables are provided for user or system
               administrator use. "$MEINSTALLPATH" defines the location of the
               MicroEmacs  standard macros and allows the built in search path
               to be  overridden.  "$MEUSERPATH"  defines the  location of the
               user  private  configuration  directory  and allows the user to
               locate  their  private  directory  in different  location. In a
               standard install neither of these variables will be required.

             * The Microsoft  Windows system defined  application path will be
               used  for user  configuration  files.  This is  applicable  for
               roaming  users where the  application  directory is stored on a
               server.

             * The use of the me32.ini file on MicroSoft Windows  environments
               is not required, but is still supported.

             * The UNIX path searching is improved. /usr/local/microemacs will
               be depreciated and replaced with  /usr/local/jasspa in addition
               other  standard path  locations are supported on a per-platform
               basis.

             * On UNIX then the directory  "~/.jasspa"  shall contain the user
               configuration  files.  Optionally  the "company" / "spelling" /
               "macros"  sub-directories  may be  included  in this  directory
               where access to the system  directory  locations by the user is
               not permitted.

             * Concept of guest has been removed.  "guest.emf" and "guest.erf"
               removed   replaced  with  "newuser".   "user-setup"  no  longer
               supports setting of name.

             * Internal variables "$user-name" and "$user-path" are defined.

    [040123] "user-setup"mouse button selection fixed.

             start  current  item  hilighting.  Added  support for C++ private
             public and protected token indentation. Added new Check-box chars

             or tested in years. Part one of Jon's Xterm key lookup fix to get
             the key pad working.

    [030710] User  setup.  Updated  osd  calls  due to the  change in 'd' flag
             behaviour  and  changed the items with drop down menus to use the
             new combo-box.

    [030710] ODS. Updated osd calls due to the change in 'd' flag behavior.

    [030710] Added new  define  for the number of history  types and added new
             "@h" history variable.

    [030710] Added support to "@mn" and "@mna" in the "meGetKey" routine

    [030710] Added  new  undo  type  for  line  reordering   undo's,  used  by
             "sort-lines" and "transpose-line".

    [030710] Changed  some define names to make them  compatible.  Changed the
             calls to  "meGetUserKey" to "meGetKey" so a macro can give a list
             of keys Added new 0 argument  which  quits at the EOB rather than
             going to the top of the buffer etc (used in page-file "isearch").

    [030710] Changed  the  logic  of the 'd'  flag  so  that it  disables  the
             displaying of the item type, changed button  rendering so that it
             adheres to this so a single char button can be created  Added new
             'O' combo box item type  which is a mixture  between an entry box
             and a sub-menu item.

    [030710] Improved  the special  char drawing  routines so that they remain
             inside the char space and triangles look good regardless of size.

    [030710] Fixed a nasty bug to do with file hooks that load other files and
             the find-file command manipulating the buffHistNo  incorrectly so
             the wrong buffer is shown - obscure!

    [030625] Added macro release makefile.

    [030625] MicroEmacs 3.8 compatibility. Fixed isearch emulation.

    [030625] First revision of page-file.

    [030625] CVS. Removed debug line.

    [030610] Changed TAB and BELL to safer  defines.  Optimized  the fill-para
             function so that it keeps one of the existing  spaces between the
             words, this also help preserve the position of anchors.

    [030610] Package making files for SunOS.

    [030608] Changed the mouse default behavior to do a move yank.

    [030608] Tools. Removed superfluous endif.

    [030608] Toolbar.  Only  update the toolbar if its the top level  command,
             i.e. the screen-update is not required due to spell-buffer (say).

    [030608] MS-Shift  region. Check for  kill-rectangle  and treat like we do
             the kill-region.

    [030608] Added  new -ve  argument  to  insert-file  which  inserts  only a
             section of the file.  Optimized  the file-op  move command to try
             just moving the file first.

    [030608] Changed  the  addLine  function  so it  always  flags the line as
             changed,  this avoids some bizarre  issues when macros  delete an
             insert  lines  of text  (best  shown by the  buffer-info  toolbar
             tool).

    [030608] Added new macro oriented  buffer-info numeric argument. Fixed bug
             in the ignore white-space buffer compare.

    [030608] Fixed default printer selection issues - not complete.

    [030608] Fixed a minor debug build issue in undo.c.

    [030608] Changed the history so it always removes any duplicate entries.

    [030608] Added "$window-eline" and moved the aline into extended version.

    [030608] Changing  the  addLine  function  to always set the changed  flag
             meant all macros became hidden, use different bits.

    [030608] Fixed a minor compile warnings.

    [030608] Fixed  buffer  reload a file while  displayed  in another  window
             problems.

    [030519] Fixed minor  compiler  warning in search.c by removing  pointless
             static initialization.

    [030519] Fixed poke over-writing cursor on win32 console.

    [030516] C Template.  Changed C #define  evaluation  to use new  protected
             narrows.

    [030516] Stopped the Organizer Find exit quitting the organizer itself.

    [030516] VM Mail. Fixes from Tom Hundt fixes message separator problem.

    [030516] Made MS-DOS redraw the cursor on a poke as well.

    [030515] Organizer.  Fixed bugs with  creating new  addresses and indexing
             etc.

    [030515] Printer.   Store   the   windows   device   information   in  the
             print-history as well.

    [030514] JST  Template.  Fixed  jst magic  hook and added  Imakefile  one.
             Changed  jst magic  hook  variable  setting  setup to use the new
             $result variable.

    [030514] HTML   Template.   Changed   html-fold   ->  collapse,   reported
             goto-matching-tag failure.

    [030514] Buffer  initialization.  Changed the  fold-setup  call so that it
             gets  called if likely to be required - use the new  buffer-fhook
             $result setting to help in determining this.

    [030514] Folding.  Changed the  fold-setup so a setup string can be passed
             in  rather  than  searching  for  one  in the  buffer,  aimed  at
             utilizing the new buffer-fhook "$result" setting.

    [030514] Set  "$result" to the magic fhook  string so the fhook macro does
             not have to search for it again in buffer.c.

    [030514] Fixed "\xb" bad regex bug.

    [030513] Search. Added region line hilighting support.

    [030513] Changed auto-spell  hilighting scheme to a new spell-error scheme
             to avoid printing issues.

    [030513] Removed old  hkfold.emf  fold  implementation.  Moved fold.emf to
             collapse.emf  and added a real folding editor support macros to a
             new fold.emf, based loosely on "fue".

    [030513] Abbreviation, Changed copy-region call to not expand the narrows.

    [030513] Latex Template. Added latex chars etc to the .eaf file.

    [030513] Search. Changed to handle the fold-open and fold-close split.

    [030513] OSD. Improved the Edit narrow  commands to take  advantage of the
             new protected narrow support.

    [030513] Tools. Fixed dummy tool removal and changed  position  setting to
             use alpha mark.

    [030513] VM Mail. Regex protected the boundary id string.

    [030513] Utils. simplified the str-to-regex by using &xrep.

    [030513] User setup. Changed fold -> collapse.

             matching and added close tag feature.

    [030513] Buffer setup.  Changed fold -> collapse and added proper  folding
             setup entries.

    [030513] Commenting. Fixed silly "\\x80" alpha char label bug.

    [030513] File Dialogue. Added tab ordering to dialog.

    [030513] Folding all templates.  Changed the function  folding commands to
             collapse to avoid confusion with real folding.

    [030513] XML Template, Added indent rules for "<? ... ?>".

    [030513] Mouse. Changed the column setting to use alpha marks.

    [030513] Color  Schemes.  Split  the  fold  scheme  into   fold-close  and
             fold-open.

    [030512] Fixed  display  matching  fence issue with poke screen hiding the
             cursor on Unix X-Windows. May need to be done on MS-DOS as well.

    [030512] Fixed  horrid crash caused in search.c by buffer  change in macro
             followed by query replace and toolbar up-date  changing the regex
             variables.

    [030512] Fixed fill-paragraph when no arg is given but at the beginning of
             para still move forward.

    [030512] Latest versions of build.txt, cygwin.txt, faq.txt and readme.txt.

    [030512] Build fix for SunOS.

    [030512] Ipipe fix for SunOS. Big  return  value  change to get  functions
             consistent  - found  that the  return  values  of low level  line
             functions where different to high level functions making the code
             hard to read and dangerous. Also needed a consistent triple value
             return (true false and error) so change  meABORT to -1 across the
             board. changed the line flag  implementation  to be more flexible
             and variable in size so UE has a smaller  memory usage and ME has
             line flags  available.  Improved the AMark  setting and deleting.
             Added a Protected  Line flag and vastly  improved the  narrowing.
             Renamed most function in line.c to make them more readable.

    [030512] Big return value change to get functions  consistent - found that
             the return values of low level line functions  where different to
             high level functions  making the code hard to read and dangerous.
             Also needed a  consistent  triple  value  return  (true false and
             error) so change meABORT to -1 across the board.

    [020523] Fixed a nasty  multi-line  regex search  failing at end of buffer
             problem.

    [020523] Added extra parameter to HideBuffer  flagging whether to hide the
             buffer if the  window  buffer  lock is set.  Changed  find-buffer

             the frame size causes problems, particularly with the toolbar.

    [020427] Major  edit!  Added  frame  support,  standardized  many  of  the
             structure and function names, introduced  $window-flags  (not the

    [011220] Added  support for a $CURSOR$ tag to the etf files which sets the
             initial cursor  position, and included h.etf as an example (thats
             been annoying me for some time).

    [011220] Moved the  template  etfinsrt  calls  into the  buffer-initialize
             macro .

    [011220] Fixed the exec fhook-cpp not working .

    [011220] Fixes to ctags for C++ function call initializers.

    [011220] Fixed Windows  Console <RETURN> key keyboard  mapping,  returning
             incorrect binding.

    [011219] Fixed Termcap <TAB> key translation.

    [011219] Fixed  Termcap  tparm() to use a default  stack  argument  if not
             specified by default.

    [011219] Added cygwin support to the build file.

    [011219] Added extra argument to buffer-initialise.

    [011218] Added support for Euphoria language.

    [011217] Italian spelling dictionary.

    [011217] Added scheme support for fence matching colors.

    [011217] Removed global binding of TAB key from  unixterm.emf and build in
             translation.

    [011215] Fixed cygwin makefile for latest version, added cygwin macros.

    [011215] Fixed remaining termcap crash under cygwin.

    [011214] Merged  prototype  cygwin  code  base into  release,  use  poll()
             following select().

    [011123] Fence  matching  added to user sertup  (user-setup -> Platform ->
             Fence Display).

    [011115] Reworked  the  buffer  hooks  such  that  mybhook/myehook  can be
             defined.

    [011031] Fixed a corking crash! (load random.c and do 2222  replace-string
             "\n" "").

    [011029] hklatex.emf item-list support (hit "f7").

    [011028] hklatex.emf has a greatly improved pseudo hilighting.

    [011028] set-position can now store the mark position.

    [011028] Fixes to windows file times.

    [011016] New caps-lock,  num-lock,  scroll-lock  and pause key support for
             win32  &  unix.  The  "*-lock"  implementation  to be  more  like
             "S-pick"  and  "C-pick" as the keys are  automatically  supported
             (like the shift) so there are no default  binds to void, the keys
             are only  generated if there are bound. Could not implement  this
             on MS-DOS.

    [011016] which  command  built  in i.e.  "M-x  which".  Used  for  command
             utilities.

    [011026] A new Hide value feature when inputting strings, this is now used
             be the crypt and ftp Password entry. The string is shown as '*'s.

             screen update rock solid.

    [011025] mlGetChar  fix. The key "return" was the 78th special  char, i.e.
             "SKEY_SPEC"|'N'   and  as  the   mlGetChar   did  not  check  the
             "SKEY_SPEC"  bits, pressing  return was like pressing 'N' so on a
             "Y/N" prompt try pressing return, its like saying No! .

    [011016] Spelling  dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because of
             the language changes, you need to rename your personal dictionary
             to lsdpengb.edf for British and lsdpenus.edf for American.

    [011016] Hilighting  brackets/braces  as  requested  from  user  base. The
             hilight   braces   required   some   other   subtle   changes  to
             screen-update and show-region and the addition of the "rbin" mode
             means that this version is incompatible  with the last in quite a
             few areas.

    [011016] Fixed  mouse  handler  (turns out that if the pick event was lost
             (use "@cg" or an error) then me would lock!).

    [011016] Extended  control on indent tab and return  behavior (can disable
             the tab behavior).

    [011016] C++ name space indentation support.

    [011016] New language support  interface so spelling is not required for a
             language to be supported (may only want the basic  alphabet setup
             etc).

    [011016] Changed file loading  interface so all commands (like  view-file)
             can load in "bin", "crypt" or "rbin" mode.

    [010123] Reduced binary mode added (rbin).

4th Release - August 2001

    [010813] OSD bug fix for fixed size dialog boxes.

    [010812] Inclusion of occur regexp function.

    [010812] List function for  summarizing  file contents ("F7" / "Esc-F7" to
             close).

    [010810] Rendered character for the scroll bar - improves clarity.

    [010810] Modified the printer registry file location.

    [010801] New Guest default color scheme.

             entry fields".

    [010716] Minor macros  modification to font selection for schemes. Default
             guest setup font selection for cleaner 'first' page.

    [010716] CVS  macro  update.   Changed   "cvs-diff"  to  "cvs-gdiff"   and
             introduced  a new  "cvs-diff"  which just gives the "diff" output
             and fixed several bugs when running with a CVS server. Also added
             support for the CVS/Template file when committing.

    [010716] Minor  update  to  the  CVS  help  page  for  the  aforementioned
             (Affected all help files).

3rd Release - July 2001

    [010713] New style WWW JASSPA Pages.

    [010712] Added    comment   and   menu   support   for   MS-DOS   and   M4
             (hkdos.emf/hkm4.emf).

    [010711] Added hpux11 support.

    [010711] Fixed windows erase when file doesn't exist problems.

    [010710] Removed  cbox  -  replaced  by  generic  comment   implementation
             (cbox.emf/me.ehf).

    [010710] Added a 'Plain  Text'  char set  which  only uses  plain  letters
             (charset.emf).

    [010710] Fixed  many  little  comment   formatting   bugs  and  annoyances
             (comment.emf).

    [010710] Changes required to build on MS-DOS using DJGPP v1.

    [010705] Bug fix for windows rendering crash.

    [010630] Minor reorder to X-Windows initialization for cygwin X-Server.

    [010507] Added   generic   commands   for  the   creation,   deletion  and
             reformatting of comments now used by most of the file hooks.

    [010412] Added new generic  buffer  setup, menu and help macros,  creating
             the new  buffer-setup(3)  command. Ported all existing file hooks
             to this new interface greatly reducing the buffer hook size while
             increasing its functionality and consistency.

    [010402] Added support for new $buffer-backup(5)  variable for setting the
             back-up file location.

    [010312] Support  for  new key  bindings  allowing  CU  emulations.  Nedit
             bindings  provided as example.  Major work to enable the complete
             re-binding of all keys so the user interface to MicroEmacs can be
             completely  changed, this allows for example a Windows feel to be
             created. This  required many internal  ghosts to be exorcized and
             add new macro functions.

    [010308] User buffer configuration menu added.

    [010308] Improved Python support (Contribution PG).

    [010304] Bug fixes to hilighting logic.

    [010228] Improved dialog box for search/replace.

    [010210] Revised  programming  language  templates;  simplified the common
             elements used in configuring the templates.

    [010202] Added new  command-wait(2)  command to enable  macros to wait for
             user dependent completion, used in "gdiff".

    [010202] Changed     buffer     variables     to    except     the    form
             ":<buffer-name>:<variable>",  like command variables. This allows
             macros to access variable not defined in the current buffer.

    [010126] File "autosave" location changes. Control save name and location.

    [001005] OSD speedups.

    [001005] Improved and  increased  the file system  operations  via the new
             file-op(2) command, created better menus in the file-browser(3).

    [001010] Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more rationally.

    [001010] Improved ipipe-shell-command efficiency on Windows by introducing
             a new thread approach to listen for activity. Implemented a shell
             command-line in an ipiped environment so ishell(3) command is now
             usable on Windows platforms.

    [001010] Added  new  set-position(2)  which  can  be  used  to  store  all
             information about the current window and  goto-position(2)  which
             will  then  restore  them.  Allowed   macros  to  use  non-letter
             characters  for alpha marks and  positions so they no longer need
             to clobber user ones.

    [001010] Added new "-k" and "-u"  command-line  options and  improved "-s"
             option.

    [000922] Added GUI for tag dialogue for tags generation.

    [000922] Recursive tags support (i.e. nested directory tag traversal).

    [000810] emain.h "#define"'s properly supported again so MicroEmacs can be
             successfully  compiled  without  options  like SPELL and OSD etc.
             This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%.

             platforms   modified  to  cope  with  font  scheme   definitions.
             Platforms optimized for speed.

    [000126] Beta build revision contains version information for 2000/01/26.

    [000126] Directory  file copy. Within this release  files in the directory
             listings  may be selected for copy and pasting from the menu. Use
             the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory buffers.
             Copy and paste  to/from a ftp  directory  buffer to a local drive
             buffer  may be used to  initiate  an ftp  transfer.  (This is how
             these pages are uploaded).

    [000126] New  command ftp opens a ftp  connection  using a dialog. Use may
             save the host  connection  information  in a registry  file. Note
             that the password information is exposed so be careful where this
             is used - if in doubt do not enter the  password  and you will be
             prompted.

    [000126] New  command  "uniq"  operates as the UNIX of the same name. used
             with sort, and reduces to unique lines.

    [000126] Character  translation; addition of character  translation macros
             when  moving  between  character  sets.  Accessible  from Menu ->
             Format -> Change Buffer Char Set.

    [000126] Support for  additional  character  sets, Windows  GREEK, Windows
             TURKISH.

    [000126] Line  hilighting  selection  with the use of the  mouse  and auto
             search.  When  using  the  mouse  selection  to  set up the  line
             hilighting when invoked from a

             > right-mouse -> Hilight Line -> color/remove

             selection; the macro  determines  the mouse  selected  region and
             makes  an  appropriate  decision  as to how the  line  hilighting
             scheme is to be applied. The  following  rules apply to the mouse
             selection:-

             * Point in line  selected  (i.e. mark == point)  Hilight the line
               only.

             * Region  in the line  selected.  Both  point and mark are on the
               same line. Extract the selected text and hilight all lines that
               match the search  pattern. The color  "remove" is also  pattern
               matched to selectively remove lines.

             * Region  selected  mark & point on different  lines Block up the
               region with appropriate hilight.

             Notethat line hilighting may be safely used in a folded buffer.

    [000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may toggle this
             from the keyboard using a macro in your user.emf as follows:-

             > ; Macro to enable the display of TAB/CR. Note that we
             > ; force the screen to be updated.
             > define-macro tab-display
             > set-variable $system &bxor $system 0x80000
             > screen-update
             > !emacro
             > global-bind-key "tab-display" "f11"

    [000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf).

    [000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta.

    [000112] Revised color hilighting schemes, reduced the number of colors in
             a number of schemes.  Introduction  of the Sherwood  Forest color
             scheme (green theme obviously !!).

    [000112] Small  revision  to the  user  interface  with  respect  to  font
             selection. In order to make  character set selection  easier then
             the  multiple  choices for the box  characters  have been removed
             from Menu -> Help -> User Setup. These have been  replaced with a
             new check box  Extended  Char Set. This box  should be checked to
             enable  the  special  rendering  characters  and  enable  the box
             characters  -  this  is  typically   enabled  on  X-Windows   and
             MS-Windows.

    [000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name,  modification  time
             and size. Selecting the directory column title performs a re-sort
             based on the selection, a further selection reverses the order of
             the list.

    [000112] Addition of ftp support (meu build on Windows, enabled by default
             on UNIX).  Enables  files to be  edited  via ftp, (read and write
             supported).      Transfer     to     another     system     using
             ftp://[<user>[:<password]@]><host>[:<port>]/<pathname>.

    [000112] Improved  source code  provision for foreign  languages,  various
             internal  problems.  Support for Russian  (Windows  and  Cyrillic
             koi8-r).

    [000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date.

    [000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized wild card
             sequences. Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf, britishr.emf,
             etc.) then the following spelling rules may be added to cope with
             numeric  sequences.  The addition of these rules will spell check
             hexadecimal sequences and validate numeric sequences such as 1st,
             2nd, 3rd etc. A  spelling  of "1nd"  would  generate  a  spelling
             error.  This  has not  been  performed  for  other  languages  so
             submissions for other language equivalents would be appreciated.

             > ; Add some special word rules to make life easier.
             > ; These are for 1st, 2nd 3rd etc.
             > add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?1\\(st\\|ST\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?2\\(nd\\|ND\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?3\\(rd\\|RD\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*1[0-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*[04-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+"
             > ; Spell rules for unit definitions.
             > ; These are for 50Mb, 10Kg, -45.56cm 12ft 10.00am 16.00pm etc.
             > add-spell-rule "*" "-?\\([0-9]*.\\)?[0-9]+\\(Kg\\|Kb\\|Gb\\|Tb\\|Mb\\|mm\\|cm\\|m\\|Km\\|ft\\|inch\\|mph\\|lb\\|am\\|pm\\)"

    [000112] Box selection copy and paste. Bindings are defined as:-

             > Esc C-w kill-rectangle
             > Esc C-y yank-rectangle

    [000112] Enhanced  info file  hilighting  (Thanks to Dr. Detlef  Groth for
             this).

    [000112] New copy-file  command,  typically used by the macro language for
             moving files around.

    [000112] Error  reporting  of bad  command  line  arguments  in  Microsoft
             Windows environment (Thanks to Pedro Gomes for this).

2nd Release - November 1999

    [991101] Enhanced the latex support macros following various contributions
             from users.

    [991101] Added  Favorites  to the File  pull down  menu.  This is a simple
             mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites list.

    [991101] Ground  up  implementation  of  the  regular  expression  pattern
             matcher,  following  licensing  problems  with the GNU regex. The
             resultant  pattern  matcher is now a little faster than GNU regex
             and is capable of all of the standard regular  expression pattern
             matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that double
             backslashes  are required in the character  classes [..] to allow
             for escape sequence short cuts such as '\n' (newline), '\t' (tab)
             etc. It was felt that this  compromise  was better than having to
             quote the more obscure search characters.

    [991101] Changed  the  hilighting  and  indenting  syntax  to be GNU regex
             compliant.

    [991101] Modified  compare-windows  to  ignore  white  space  by  default,
             compare-windows-exact  performs an exact  character for character
             comparison.

    [991101] Enhanced the tags support to handle  multiple  tags and recursive
             directory tree searching.

    [991101] Implemented  osd-help,  a gui  front  end  to the  on-line  help.
             Required  changes to the help system which gives macros access to
             the on-line help buffer, needed for the index and search.

    [991101] Over-hauled the hilighting scheme files and editor to support the
             disabling of buffer hilighting.

    [991101] Many bugs fixed on all platforms, in particular  unix cutting and
             pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit delay.

    [991101] Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.

    [991101] Introduced message line variables "@mx" and "@mxa".

    [991101] New  Games  -  Crossword  cracker.  The  ideal  way to  cheat  at
             crosswords.  Uses the spelling  dictionary  to guess at the word,
             given a number of known letters.

    [991101] Hook  file  protection  against  globally  bound  keys - prevents
             re-binding of user defined keys within the macro.

    [991101] Search/Replace  fix for exact mode.  Environment  variable search
             path fix.

    [991101] hkm4.emf  added  back  into  the  release  (seemed  to have  gone
             missing).

    [991101] Cut and  paste  fix when  running  the UNIX  version  through  an
             X-Server such as Exceed in the Windows environment.

    [991101] Plain text printer device added.

    [991101] Obscure OSD fix.

    [991101] New OSD help search facility Menu->Help->General Help.

    [991101] Fix for NT  hang-up  on shut  down  (typically  encountered  when
             running a source debugger).

    [991101] Fix for NT process spawning with spaces in the names.

    [991101] Metris macro fix, OSD bug fix, NT display fix.

    [991101] New - color scheme, GVim look.

    [991101] New - Unix/Linux support for Wheel Mouse (mouse.emf).

    [991101] New - Color  schemes,  Plain;  for those  that do not care for an
             abundance of colors.

    [991101] Modified the numeric  key-pad  behavior to be  consistent  on all
             platforms.   Problems  were  noted  with  the  UNIX  number  lock
             orientation which was reversed.

    [991101] New - Color  scheme  variables  which  allow  the hkXXX  files to
             determine the level of hilighting to apply to their templates.

    [991101] Line  length fix; more  graceful  behavior  (i.e. does not crash)
             when the line length exceeds 64K.

    [991101] Intercept  the windows 105 keyboard  application  key  (typically
             right hand side of keyboard  next to the control key). The key is
             called  "menu". By default  this is bound in  win32.emf,  however
             users may bind it as a prefix for their own key  combinations  in
             much the same way as "Alt" or "C-x" if required.

    [991101] New; OMG's IDL language template added.

    [991101] Fix for windows short name in next-buffer.

2nd Release - Beta #1 - May 1999.

    [990501] Bug fixes with multi-language support and spelling dictionaries.

    [990501] Fixed  fill-paragraph such that it retains the cursor position in
             the paragraph when invoked without arguments.

    [990501] Moved to GNU regex for search/replace engine.

    [990501] Enhanced  isearch such that it operates in *shell[990501  buffers
             (again).

    [990501] gdiff  macro  implementation  of a graphical  diff to allow color
             annotation of  differences  and  difference  selection.  Uses the
             output of a standard diff(1) utility.

    [990501] 2nd port to IBM AIX.

             solve many of the foreign language problems.

    [990101] Re-worked  the ALT key mapping to allow  conventional  Emacs meta
             key bindings.

    [990101] Implemented Auto-Spell utility.

    [990101] Introduction  of private macro  variables of the form ".name" and
             ".macro.name".

    [990101] Port to Sun Solaris Intel platform (2.6).

    [990101] Merged the init-hilight and hilight-token into the single hilight
             command. Similarly for indent.

    [990101] Enhanced the regexp support in hilight  tokens, vastly  improving
             it capability and usability. Similarly for indent tokens.

Daniel M. Lawrence - Microemacs V3.8 distribution.

    Daniel Lawrence turned MicroEmacs into an editor for the masses, it is his
    work that  ultimately  made MicroEmacs so popular. Daniel did a tremendous
    amount of work,  both  adding  features  and  supporting  other  platforms
    resulting in the MicroEmacs  v3.8 release on which JASSPA's  MicroEmacs is
    based.

Late 1985/early 1986

    Dave Conroy, the original  author, first  developed the original code base
    for private use. Various  people  asked Dave for a copy of the program and
    it was distributed  without concern for copyrights or ownership as was the
    custom of that era.
