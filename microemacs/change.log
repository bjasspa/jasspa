    [050410] Fixed the -R option for DOS box,  cursor  same as the  foreground
             color which is not ideal!
             
    [050410] Fixed the SunOS x86 makefile to disabled  #pragam  warnings under
             GCC.

    [050409] Release Candidate 2 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC2)

    [050408] Added flag to the user-setup  Tools to force the rereading of the
             current buffer's file, thanks to Bryan Schofield.

    [050408] Added new .item-list.width  variable to allow control of the item
             window list - submitted by Bryan Schofield.

    [050408] Moved the  generate  tags into the sub folder and added a compile
             option to c and cpp - submitted by Bryan Schofield.

    [050405] Added  support  for  DOS  code  page  866  (Cyrillic  Russion)  -
             submitted by Nicholas Kudriavtsev

    [050331] Added support for the setting of the history in macros via @h#.

    [050325] registry.c - removed compiler warning  indicating porting problem
             hilighted  under  Darwin. Post  increment  of variable on left of
             assignment and same variable appeared on the right, split out the
             increment to reduce ambiguity of the statement.

    [050320] UNIX only - add a rule for .dir files found in the X11 directory.
             We do not want this files identified as "dir" info root file

    [050320] Added termcap (white) scheme for reverse video operation.

    [050320] Newuser  registry  file -  added  default  entry  for  Apple  Mac
             "darwin". Confirmed operation under Mac X-Windows.

    [050320] Extended ME exit  commands to support the  discarding of modified
             buffers '0x8 discard modified buffers' and '0x10 discard modified
             buffers and create recovery file for changes'.

    [050320] Corrected  XML syntax for strings "..." to fix indent and hilight
             anomalies.

    [050319] Added -R  command  line  option  to  reverse  the  built in video
             schemes - specifically for ne(1) also works with me(1).

    [050319] Corrected  default mode settings.  Recent  removal of letter(2m),
             line(2m) etc. changed the mode byte assignment of some modes. The
             built in global  mode  default was not updated for this change in
             bytes  and  incorrect   global  modes  appeared  as  a  result  -
             specifically quiet(2m) which has jumped bytes.

    [050315] LEX/YACC template - Corrected LEX and YACC highlighting.  Aligned
             C, C++ and YACC/LEX templates to be consistent.

    [050315] C/C++  templates - buffer  setup  modified  for GNU Indent  Style
             setting.

    [050315] Added new browse(3)  command and binding to f3, changed  existing
             collapse-all f3 binding to C-f2.

    [050315] Modified  ME exit  commands to support a bitwise arg n where main
             exit-emacs  has '0x01  Prompt',  '0x02  Save each  buffer/reg/dic
             (with  prompt if 0x01  set)' and '0x04  Prompt  for exit code and
             exit ME with that code.'

    [050313] Latex  template -  Corrected  the  latex-fill-paragraph.  Set the
             fill-mode  to 'l'  rather  than 'L'  because  its a pain  when it
             selects centre rather than left and messes things up.

    [050311] Directory  list - changed  column  sorting so  Modified is sorted
             most recent first.

    [050311] Fixed perldb pipe operation.

    [050310] OSD  simplified the main context menu and moved paste a cvs items
             in the directory context menu

    [050310] Fixed diff's file name input, was not completing correctly

    [050310] CVS changed the default setting of the recursive add to off.

    [050310] JASSPA MicroEmacs quick start document released.

    [050309] Fixed bug in regex  multi-line  search  backwards,  searching for
             "foo[^a]" is a mult-line as [^a] matches \\n, if "foob" exists at
             the start of the line isearch-backward refuses to move on.

    [050309] Catman pages added for ne(1) and me(1)  complaints with gentoo as
             missing. Added to the package builds.

    [050308] Fixed a nasty  bug with ftp  connect  dialog  when the host has a
             port. Changed the default path to be nothing which becomes /~/ to
             list the login directory. Change the tab order to not include the
             password  as tabbing  through  the entry will lose the  password,
             must now access via mouse or hot key which is not ideal.

    [050308] Added  support for relative ftp browsing via new  ftp://???/~/???
             url form. Added file name completion support for ftp

    [050306] Corrected the docmacro http:// ling regular expression.

    [050306] Changed the date format of the -V command  line option to include
             the century, same format as the about(2) buffer.

    [050302] HTLP and PHP - fixed indent problems.

    [050302] Perl template - fixed indent  problems caused by not skipping the
             =~ type regex's

    [050302] TCL template - fixed continuation and comment indent bug.

    [050302] Added support for R/S-plus (.r) files - thanks to Detlef.

    [050225] HTML  template  - fixed an  indent  which was fixed at "2" rather
             than "t" and added comment skipping indent rules

    [050225] dos2unix, unix2dos and unix2win - Removed use of &spr in favor of
             &cat so dos2unix etc work in ne.

    [050225] Tracing a problem  with  hilighting  a token of the form  "AB*$",
             works if there is a B but  fails if there  are no 'B's, i.e. only
             matches  "AB+$". Found that removing the end of line special case
             code fixes the  problem. I believe  the rest of the code has been
             improved to handle any end-of-line quirks - I hope so!

    [050225] Removed  the  'start-up'  macro  function  compile  option so all
             versions support this - "ne" can now do a "@dos2unix"

    [050225] Regular  expressions - extended  replacement string syntax. Added
             support  for "\c#" "\l#" and "\u#" to change  the case of groups,
             where "\c#" is capitalise,  "\l#" is lower "\u#" is upper and "#"
             is the group number (0-9, &)

    [050225] Regular  expressions - changed syntax of "\s?" and "\S?" in favor
             of perl's  simpler  "\s" and "\S" for a  whitespace  char  class.
             Added new character  classes "\d" = digits, "\D" != digits "\h" =
             hexdigits  "\H" != hexdigits  "\l" = lowercase  "\L" != lowercase
             "\u" = uppercase  and "\U" != uppercase.  These changes were made
             to both the main regex  search  engine and the  hilight(2)  token
             matching  engine. Added support for char classes  within the main
             regex  [...]  character  class,  i.e. now  supports  regexs  like
             "[\l\u_]" for any lower, upper or '_' char. This is not supported
             in the hilight which currently has a more simplistic "[...]" char
             class support.

    [050225] Regular  expressions  -  changed  use of "\s ", "\s-",  "\S " and
             "\S-"  classes  to  simply  "\s"  and "\S"  which  is perl  regex
             compliant (ditching Emacs "\s" syntax as it is cumbersome and not
             very useful). The only nasty side effect is hilight's miss-use of
             "\S1" - "\S9" to mean  not "\1" - "\9"  group  char,  changed  to
             "\!1" - "\!9"

    [050224] NE set to not auto-save or create backups by default.

    [050224] Added "-a" and "-B"  command  line  options to enable and disable
             auto-save and backup modes.

    [050224] Tcl template - some more fixes to the item list from Detlef

    [050224] watch -  improved  the  refresh  rate  of a type 2 or 3 watch  by
             ignoring the :watch time and just look at the :watch-size.  Fixed
             the split  line  issue  with type 2 of 3 watching  caused by last
             line not being complete.

    [050224] M-x ftp - stripped  'ftp://'  and any  trailing  '/' of the users
             entered  host name as these  break  ftp.  Improved  the  dialog's
             handling of  passwords,  the user can now tell if a password  has
             been set.

    [050224] Added standard binding for mark-function

    [050224] Fixed the ME token hilighting in the C hook

    [050224] Removed  recently  added  %no_backup  variable to disable  backup
             create as new -B option is a much better way of doing it.

    [050224] edef.h - Removed definition of non-existant variable

    [050224] Fixed failure when trying to load "http://www.jasspa.com",  there
             is an implicit trailing '/' which MicroEmacs now adds.

    [050224] Tcl template - major improvement - courtesy of Detlef.

    [050224] Fixed  collapse to support the file hooks .exact  setting (set to
             -1 means case insensitive)

    [050224] Added      new      beginning-of-function,       end-of-function,
             goto-function-line and mark-function macros - thanks to Detlef.

    [050223] Windows  MS-dev  6  project  -  corrected  project  settings  for
             _URLSUPP => _SOCKET in keeping  with the socket  dynamic  library
             loading.

    [050223] Added exec of wish to the tcl magic hook

    [050223] Fixed $window-chars - added OSD default button chars.

    [050222] Fixed $user-path being more that 35 chars breaking the user-setup
             dialog.

    [050222] Directory listing - call fhook-html when file is a http:// file -
             this is never a directory listing.

    [050222] Stopped  loading of files in dir listing when clicking way to the
             right,  must click on the name (ME kept  loading  files when just
             trying to raise the window to the front - annoying).

    [050222] If 0 given  to watch  call  watch-time,  this  preserves  the old
             interface.

    [050222] Added   backup  file   disabling   for   "dos2unix"   macros  via
             command line defineable variable.

    [050221] Changed the new Windows process tree killing to use LoadLibrary()
             to detect whether the OS supports this feature (and NT does not).
             Also moved the URL support over to LoadLibrary() so we can remove
             the -u builds.

    [050220] Added UNIX Shell and Makefile hilighting to notes(2).

    [050219] Fixed GNU GCC  warnings  in  Makefiles  for  #pragma in X11 files
             under Sun Solaris and uninitialized variables.

    [050219] OSD. Removed  dialog 'F' flag as it was not  documented,  did not
             work and only used in one obscure  place. Fixed C-g & Del so they
             close up to the previous dialog but does close the main menu down
             in one call - was annoying.

    [050219] Release Candidate 1 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC1)

    [050218] Corrected  UNIX  client-server  socket  file check -- bad test on
             existence of  connection  file, using wrong  variable  with wrong
             test sense.

    [050218] Added site delete button to ftp-connect dialog.

    [050218] Fixed abbreviation and exec-string "\\p" and "\\P" store and goto
             position  problem  when  the C-x C-a or C-x a keys  are  rebound.
             Fixed by replacing with 'esc x set-alpha-mark  P' (where esc x is
             a safe internal special key).

    [050218] Updated watch  interface and made public.  Created new watch-time
             command and prompt user for watch type when no argument is given.

    [050218] Removed  the use of bit  0x1000 in ada string  hilight as this is
             unlikely to be wanted (probably copied from Pascal).

    [050218] Changed the registry  parser to abort on error rather than trying
             to carry on (a very  painful  process for a badly  decrypted  reg
             file)

    [050218] Fixed  highlighting minor issues. Hilight scheme now returns back
             to EOL  scheme  after a  bracket.  A  branch  tag on an EOL  line
             removes  the EOL flag so it  hilights  correctly.  Branch tag now
             supports the 0x1000  single line  hilight.  Lookback now supports
             0x800 on a branch tag.

    [050217] HTML  highlighting.  Fixed some really grizzly scripted HTML page
             highlighting issues, predominantly with php.

    [050217] Change  ftp so it opens  the  ftp-connect  dialog if the  current
             buffer is *ftp-files*.

    [050217] Fixed ftp dir list column  detection and highlighting  issue with
             windows ftp servers (time given as 9:15 not 09:15)

    [050217] Fixed bug in set-variable and unset-variable when &spr is used to
             create a variable name.

    [050217] Watch command  (watch.emf).  Improved the watch  command, made '0
             watch' call watch-reset,  changed watch-reset so with an argument
             of 0 it removes  all watches  otherwise  it resets the main watch
             counter and reports to the user which buffers are watched.  Added
             new '2 watch' & '3 watch' which compares the file size, doing the
             following:

                * file on disk is smaller than last watch - reloads whole file
                * file size is the same - does nothing
                * file on disk is  larger - appends  to the end of the  buffer
                  the tail of the file (file_size - watch_file_size bytes)

             This assumes that the files is always being appended  (reasonable
             assumption in most cases. The only difference  between 2 and 3 is
             that 2 forces a  complete  reread  of the file on the first  file
             change  (ensuring the buffer is correct), 3 does not which allows
             the  user to  trash  the  first  gigabyte  of the  buffer  before
             starting the watch.

    [050217] Shell  template - added local and  function  keywords and fixed a
             few string highlighting problems.

    [050216] Made  the  dir-listing's  (Filtered)  label  on line 2  pickable,
             changing the filter status when picked Made CVS's CVS-Quick label
             pickable doing a full reread when picked.

    [050216] Fixed a  couple  of silly  register  bugs  introduced  with  last
             find-reg  concatenate root and sub-key change. Improved  behavior
             when ftp erf file is missing,  now create a new one in memory and
             flags as changed so should be saved on exit.

    [050216] Do not abort me.emf execution if ftp erf file is missing or bad.

    [050216] Fixed by removing the 'startup'  function, the main init now uses
             dofile  directly  and it  checks  for  either  a NULL  or "" as a
             filname and replaces with "me" or ("ne" and does not complain) if
             found to be empty.  This  means that give  execute-file  an empty
             string  executes  either "me" or "ne", i.e. resets me - nice side
             effect. Changed  'dofile()' to execFile() and changed  execFile()
             to executeFile()  (as is function for command  execute-file)  and
             change the other exec command function names for consistency.

    [050216] Fixed an  annoyance  reported by Bruno, ne should not complain if
             it fails to find ne.emf - fair enough.

    [050215] Fixed  crash  caused  by using -c option  with all  files  hidden
             (comment  when  browsing  ftp dirs as cache dir lists are hidden)
             The startup  process  knows the history  created  buffers but the
             replacement  was none of these and due to the  tool-bar  it was a
             buffer without a file name and bang! Fixed in 2 ways, first check
             the  replacement  has a file name, second do not put hidden files
             into the history - they're hidden.

    [050210] Improved  movement  between  items using the cursor in the search
             dialog.

    [050210] Fixed cvs dialog default settings

    [050210] Corrected search path expansion, incorrectly handling a PATH_CHAR
             at the start of the string.

    [050209] Up-dated  user-setup  platform  page to new style and added  yank
             rectangle binding.

    [050209] Fixed no-color termcap $window-char variable setting

    [050209] Fixed hot keys (were 3 'U's) in osdmisc.emf

    [050209] Added  new   BraceStatement   indent   value  to  support  GNU  C
             indentation style.

    [050209] Fixed the osdDisp()  function  required a TTflush  otherwise  the
             cursor is left in the wrong position on termcap systems.

    [050209] Fixed the default $window-char variable setting.

    [050209] Fixed the DOS home directory setting and compiler warnings.

    [050208] Changed  the C indent  definition  to be the same  format  as the
             existing indent  definitions  i.e. uses flag & indent value, this
             makes it more flexible and extendible. Updated macro files.

    [050205] Password generation macros added to contrib directory.

    [050205] Added  JavaDoc  highlighting  to Java  template.  Enablement  via
             buffer-setup. Removed the existing "my" extensions from contrib.

    [050205] Added  Doxygen,  <stdint.h>  and  error   highlighting  to  C/C++
             templates. Enablement via buffer-setup. Removed the existing "my"
             extensions from contrib.

    [050204] osd - Fixed problems with the 'cursor shows current item' feature
             of osd caused by the cursor position going outside of the window.

    [050202] Added an initial item number to the favorite and buffer menus.

    [050203] Standardized  narrow anchor and line flag movement behaviors with
             respect to deleting and inserting  text. Enforced to  effectively
             exist at character column -1 and been strict about  maintaining a
             protected  line. Made undo cope with markup  lines that are lost.
             These changes may be a little to severe - we'll see.

    [050202] Fixed C-g close osd dialog crash.

    [050202] Directory  listing  - fixed  nasty  bug  cause  by the  directory
             changing  on disk  before  the hook has  managed  to do  anything
             leading to a failure - this has been annoying Jon for some time!

    [050127] hkemf.emf - Fixed !until indent rule

    [050127] First revision of "notes".

    [050127] Fixed positional  problems with mouse rectangle regions and added
             a mouse rectangle yank to user-setup.

    [050127] CVS - Set the initial osd dialog item to be the first item rather
             than the Okay button (with is still the default button).

    [050127] Fixed *scratch* hook  assignment  issues, initial  startup buffer
             and only buffer delete problem.

    [050127] Added process tree killing for windows, tested on win98, 2k & XP,
             would be good to test on win95  (which  should work) and NT which
             should  not  work but  hopefully  will be no worse  than  current
             version.

             This is a process  tree killing for ipipes, in win32  killing the
             process we create is simply not good enough, all child  processes
             continue unaffected. For example, run compile, kill the buffer in
             mid compile and it carries on behind your back!

             For  Unix we use a new  group  and kill the  group,  DOS does not
             support  ipipe. We could have used the new Job  concept in ME but
             this  is  only  present  in  win2000  & XP and the  binaries  are
             unlikely  to run on win98  etc. This  should  run on every  win32
             platform although it is unlikely to do anything positive on an NT
             box (works in win2k)

    [050126] Changed  the  location  of the  fhook-default  macro  so its only
             defined if using buffinit (i.e. if running main me.emf)

    [050126] Fixed osd button repeat issue when current focus is an entry.

    [050126] Changed  "insert-file-name" to insert buffer name if a -ve arg is
             given, bound to C-x y, this replaces ml-lines esc y feature.

    [050123] Fixed a crash  caused by too many  closed  fences, the  recursive
             nature of the  findfence()  function  triggers  a stack  crash at
             around 22000 on windows. Set limit to 256 nested fences.

    [050122] Fixed  "dir"  mode loss on a  directory  re-read,  this  caused a
             number of side effects  including loss of  highlighting  and user
             prompt to reload the directory when it had changed.

    [050119] Removed the "sub-key"  argument  from all registry  related calls
             ("&reg" and  "set-registry"). The registry calls used to comprise
             two  arguments  "root" and  "sub-key",  the  "sub-key"  is really
             redundant  and the same effect may be achieved by a simple string
             concatenation of the "sub-key" to the "root".

    [050119] Added "my-*hook-always" macro checks in the buffer hook switching
             to permit  global  file hooks to be defined,  this  allows a file
             hook to operate on all  buffers.  "my-*hook-always"  is  executed
             after the language file hooks of "*hook-XXX" and "my-*hook-XXX".

    [050116] Added "TODO" highlighting rule for Makefile comments.

    [050114] Fixed narrow(2) type numeric argument not processed correctly.

    [050113] Added toolbar tool mouse select region command.

    [050113] Added bindings for the cvs and ftp console tools.

    [050113] Fixed organizer(3) duplicate index bug.

    [050111] Deleted the  get-registry(2)  command, this has been  depreciated
             and &reg should be used instead.

    [050111] Extended the  read-registry(2)  and save-registry(2)  commands to
             permit  reading and writing from a buffer based registry  (rather
             than file).

    [050111] Extended  list-registry(2)  to permit listing of specific  nodes,
             the output buffer of the registry listing may be specified. Added
             a  invisible  flag  to a  registry  node  which  hides  the  node
             completely (but can be toggled).

    [050111] Fixed windows  server cmd file polling of up to 60 times a second
             by making the adder of the command responsible for 'waking' ME by
             sending a WM_USER  message.  This is not a problem for UNIX as it
             is possible to wait on file input and EOF is not reported.

    [050105] Fixed several  narrow-to  usability  issues, with these fixes the
             top and bottom narrow cannot be removed without a markup line and
             the order cannot get muddled.

    [050105] Fixed a problem with the anchor position up-date when inserting a
             whole line.

    [050105] Changed  the osd entry  mouse  handling to always  refocus,  this
             allows the user to change location in the current entry using the
             mouse.

    [050105] Fixed. insert-macro undo location was incorrect causing a crash.

    [050103] Spelling  dialog.  Changed the Ignore  button to Continue if word
             becomes   correct  without   changing  (word  added  or  language
             changed).

    [050103] Fixed. CVS osd dialog with bad hot-key.

    [050102] Added setting of $recent-keys variable.

    [041231] Variable    "$fmatchdelay"    renamed   to   "$pause-time".   The
             "$pause-time" is now used for other  MicroEmacs  delay times when
             the user is prompted for information.

    [041224] Fixed several usability issues in the search replace dialog.

    [041224] Up-graded printer-setup dialog to new style OSD.

    [041224] CVS dialog - added read-only option to checkout and update.

    [041224] Fixed goto-line offset which as always going to the previous line
             (one out).

    [041221] Added  support  for proper kill buffer use in message  line, i.e.
             set-mark,  kill-region,  copy-region, yank and reyank all work in
             the same way as a normal buffer.

    [041221] Fixed registry node deletion when the node is modified.

    [041221] Removed osd 0 'd' flag and added 'I' initial item and 'D' default
             button  flags,  existing  osd dialogs  which use 'd' will fail to
             load and need are migrated to use the D and I flags.

    [041218] auto-spell  key  bindings  are  promoted to global so its easy to
             enable in any buffer.

    [041218] Corrected  setting of the $home  environment  variable  to handle
             MS-Windows '\\'s, auto terminate with '/'.

    [041210] Added Enable/Disable Auto-Spell to the context menu.

    [041210] Rearranged the organizer dialog to be a little easier to navigate
             through.

    [041210] Fixed nedit emulation insert binding.

    [041210] Removed "ml-clear" command, replaced with "0 ml-write".

    [041210] Removed the  change-directory  commands, a change in directory is
             achieved by changing the "$buffer-fname" value such that the path
             defines the location of the command. All macros operated relative
             to the buffer location and never explicitly changed the directory
             location.

    [041210] Fixed CUA emulation insert binding.

    [041210] Deleted   letter(2m)   mode.   Use   the   default   binding   of
             "forward-delete-char"  for letter mode off, where single  deleted
             characters  are to be added to the kill buffer then the  existing
             letter(2m)    mode   may   be   achieved   by   binding   as   "1
             forward-delete-char".        Similarly       for       backspace,
             "backward-delete-char".

    [041210] Deleted  line(2m)  mode. Use a binding of "1 kill-line"  to mimic
             the  line(2m)  mode  enabled and  "kill-line"  for line(2m)  mode
             disabled.

    [041210] Deleted cmode(2m). Electric-c is now configured with indent(2). C
             and C++ indent  styles  can be  different,  can also have a GNU C
             style  etc, can  change  the  indent  width  as new  indent  rule
             supports 't', consistent $buffer-indent interface.

    [041210] Created new osd file  "osdmisc.emf" for miscellaneous OSD macros,
             this removes the OSD  dependency  when the MicroEmacs is executed
             in special  start up modes with  startup  files. Moved search and
             new  indent-setup  commands out of "search.emf"  and "format.emf"
             into a new  "osdmisc.emf"  as they cause problems with utils that
             do not run "me.emf" (e.g. "ehftools.emf")

    [041210] Introduced  a  GNU  emacs   emulation  mode,  emulation  file  is
             "meemacs.emf".

    [041209] Fixed newuser  "$user-name.emf"  conflict  issue with an existing
             macro (e.g.  zaurus.emf)  by testing for it and prefixing a digit
             to make the file unique.

    [041209] Added esc C-\\ binding to restyle-buffer.

    [041209] Fixed some issues with the Tools user-setup dialog.

    [041128] Added MinGW  makefile  posted to JASSPA  group, forms part of the
             release makefiles.

    [041126] Added  'k'  keyboard  setup  to  set-char-mask  which  is used to
             translates foreign keys to a latin char.

    [041126] Changed  the  internal  LEADER  byte  to  0x1c as 0xff is a valid
             Russian char and it badly breaks $vars and macros.

    [041126] Fixed spell dump word which was not  translating the words to the
             users char-set.

    [041126] Added support for Russian language.

    [041126] Improved  the  aff  ispell  conversion   routines  (almost  works
             automatically).

    [041126] Stopped  auto-spell  from  triggering the no dictionaries  error,
             leave it to spell-buffer etc.

    [041125] Fixed OSD  multi-line C-k kill-line  behavior and  implemented -1
             kill-line support.

    [041125] Added basic support for Verilog programming language.

    [041123] Fixed ftp OSD (auto  entering  entries broke the password  field)
             and modernized.

    [041028] Fixed. *find* buffer exhibits the same behavior as *grep* buffer.
             i.e. the *find* buffer  remains on screen and a pop-up  window is
             used to show the file.

    [041028] Fixed.  *grep*  buffer  does not load  file  when  selected  with
             <RETURN>.

    [041027] Spruced  up old  "apache.conf"  highlighting  rules  and added to
             release.

    [041022] Fixed very obscure cvs load-up bug.

    [041122] Updated  schemes to set 'Show cursor in osd' suitably and to make
             sure the cursor is not red as this conflicts with the match fence
             display.

    [041120] Fixed transpose-line crash when undo mode is disabled.

    [041120] Removed  the  OSD  explicit  tab  order  value  as  this  was not
             constructively used and causes many item order problems.

    [041119] Many   improvements  to  OSD  dialog  user  interface   following
             suggestions  for news group.  Updated  most of the osd dialogs to
             use the new [*] checkbox  chars. Fixed  tabbing  orders and moved
             some  items  over to  combo-boxes.  Added  osd-cursor  visibility
             support to  scheme-edit.  Made the displaying of the cursor in an
             osd dialog a $system bit set by the hilight  scheme and fixed the
             position when in a child dialog.

    [041118] Added a macro  recursion depth limit of 20 to avoid blowing up ME
             when the user has created an infinitely recursive macro.

    [041112] Added Paul Boekholt's suggested GNU Emacs key bindings.

    [041107] kill-paragraph,     fill-paragraph,     forward-paragraph     and
             backward-paragraph  commands redefined.  kill-paragraph now kills
             forward  and  backward  rather  than  control  the  kill  buffer.
             Paragraph  movement now defined  blank-line to blank-line  rather
             than the first/last paragraph line.

    [041105] Fixed kill-lines and kill-word numerical argument implementation.

    [041104] Removed  "regex-forward"  and  "regex-backward"  macros and moved
             uses of them over to search-buffer.

    [041104] Added  "search-buffer"  command which replaces the macro commands
             "regex-forward" and "regex-backward". Simplifies macro processing
             of  searching  by  providing  a search that  explicitly  sets the
             "exact" and "magic" modes. The default is to repect buffers exact
             and  magic  mode and  flags  must have E or M to ensure  they are
             disabled.

    [041104] Changed any use of  "kill-line"  to "1 kill-line"  as this should
             maintain  its  required  behavior. A "kill-line"  with no numeric
             argument  kills  to the end of the line but  excludes  the end of
             line character (GNU Emacs  compatibility). The default binding is
             the "1 kill-line" form, re-bind the key to "kill-line" if the end
             of line is not to be killed.

    [041104] Removed  line and letter  buffer modes as these can be done using
             numerical  arguments to bindings. See the the "kill-line" binding
             which   replaces   line  mode.  See   "forward-delete-char"   and
             "backward-delete-char" binding which replaces letter mode.

    [041104] Changed the "kill-word"  commands to be more  consistent with GNU
             Emacs.

    [041102] Moved winterm over to using  addKeyToBufferOnce()  for mouse move
             and  time,  also  done  same  for UNIX  mouse  time  event.  This
             minimizes  the number of mouse moved events that are processed by
             the system.

    [041101] MS Windows. Fixed mouse cursor  disappearing  after using a Shift
             or Control mouse button event.

    [041101] Auto reload the directory even if it is changed (hkdirlst.emf).

    [041030] MS-Windows. Removed the  "WM_INPUTLANGCHANGE"  message handler as
             this did the  wrong  thing  (use  Alt-Shift  to change  between 2
             different keyboards e.g. US and Russian)

    [041030] MS-Windows.  Changed  the method used to get the APPDATA  path to
             use  SHGetSpecialFolderLocation()  as  this is  available  in all
             versions of Windows.

    [041030] UNIX. Fixed the mouse movement which caused a rendering  anomaly.
             Mouse moved  commands are only added to the key buffer if the key
             is not already  present in the key queue. This alleviates a large
             build  up of  redundant  mouse  move  keys on the  queue.  (Added
             function addKeyToBufferOnce())

    [041030] Added mouse rectangle  region selection  methods,  copy-rectangle
             and kill-rectangle.

    [041029] Hardened C++ commenting on // alignment when the previous line is
             a solid ////////// when re-styling buffer.

    [041029] Fixed "*find*"  buffer  operation so that it operates like *grep*
             on file  selection.  Keyboard  file  section  enabled  within the
             "*grep*" and "*find*" buffer.

    [041029] Added Apache configuration file highlighting rules.

    [041026] Spruced up old "smb.conf"  highlighting rules, brought them up to
             date with latest keywords and added to release.

    [041026] Fixed indent-setup osd dialog.

    [041024] Macro/source  compatibility  macro and source versions updated to
             "20041001".

    [041024] Fixed the cvs-diff options, local with HEAD was not correct.

    [041024] Latex template extended. Buffer bindings for underscore and quote
             keys. Search tools to determine current context.

    [041023] Extended  the  buffer  setup for the  indent  mechanism.  May now
             specify  the  default  buffer  indent-width  and  tab-size in the
             buffer setup dialog.

    [041022] Revised  indentation  implementation.  The  templates  now define
             indent  width  independent  rules. The  indent  commend  'indent'
             parameter  may be defined as an absolute  indentation  or using a
             't'  notation.  The  syntax  is  "[-][[indent][/indent]]t"  which
             defines a vulgar  fration  of 't' which is the  indent  width (or
             tabsize) as specified by "$buffer-indent-width" defined below.

             The  global  variables  "$tabsize"  renamed  "$indent-width"  and
             controls  the  global   indentation  size.  "$tabwidth"   renamed
             "$tab-width"  and  controls  the  display  size of a literal  TAB
             character.

             The indentation is now specified on a buffer basis, the variables
             "$buffer-indent-width"   and   "$buffer-tab-width"   define   the
             indentation and TAB width on a per buffer basis. These are seeded
             from the aforementioned global variables.

    [041022] Fixed spelling mistake in user interface of XML macros.

    [041022] Removed  CVS  "Log:"  field  from  all  of the  template  files -
             undesirable.

    [041022] Added HTTP highlighting to the text document template.

    [041021] Enhanced Wiki language template.

    [041021] Added Windows CUA emulation mode.

    [041019] Fixed insert binding for Nedit emulation mode

    [041019] Fixed perl highlighting rules. Using incorrect syntax.

    [041016] Fixed UNIX make files for building NE in debug mode.

    [041016] Fixed termcap entry for ^@ key (C-space).  (Thanks to Bob Paddock
             for noting ommission)

    [041016] Added M-% binding to  query-replace  as built in binding. (Thanks
             to Bob Paddock)

    [041016] Added Ruby programming language support.

    [041015] Corrected  problem with directory  listing  loosing  highlighting
             (@mna problem).

    [041014] Within OSD, fixed spelling mistake. Loose -> Lose

    [041014] Fixed delete-hilight-lines failure when buffer file has changed.

    [041009] Fixed  osd  entry  scheme as the  cursor  was not  visible  in MS
             Dev-Studio Colors.

    [041009] Added Wiki language template

    [041003] Wheel mouse binding added as default.

    [041003] Catch long lines from cut and paste, resolve crash.

    [041002] Added X-Windows drag and drop support using xdnd.

    [040930] Added HTML, XML and SGML close bracket auto expansion.

    [040930] Added XML and HTML verification macro. Added XML utilities macros
             to allow next and  previous tag to be matched. The XML  utilities
             are also used by SGML.

    [040930] Added  xxxx-pre-expand-abbrev  hook so that  macros may add their
             own expansion methods.

    [040917] Added <...> as supported fences.

    [040917] Fixed the -1 add-next-line ignore line feature.

    [040915] cvs-add  looks for a Tags file in the CVS  directory and sets the
             GUI  state  appropriately.  Added  server to the  cvs-state  line
             mangling.

    [040909] cvs GUI updated with new features. Added repository set up to the
             UI. Reduced wait time on long commands by using ipipe. Allowed -z
             option to be used with %cvs-com.

    [040828] About page includes the century in the date (suggested by -Th)

    [040824] Fix for man page hyper-link when includes -/./_ characters.

    [040814] Linux manual page formatting fixes.

Minor Patch - July 2004

    [040728] Released patches.

    [040728] Corrected Linux kernel 2.6 pty allocation.

    [040630] Linux manual page formatting fixes.

    [040518] Comment  definition  corrections  for C, C++  and  java,  notable
             doxygen comment formation omitted.

    [040518] Corrected block comment  formatting, adding an extra space at the
             end of the comment.

7th Release - March 2004

    [040326] Release wrapped - public release tag is "20040301" for executable
             and macros.

    [040326] Support for MAC O/S Darwin image.  Console only (no build machine
             available for X-11 version).

    [040326] Introduction of UPX on Windows and DOS executables for ne only.

    [040326] Support  for MS-DOS  long name under  DJGPP v2.0. For version 2.0
             then the DJGPP  functions  must be invoked rather than the MS-DOS
             BIOS calls otherwise the modified short name is returned. DJGPPv1
             is still supported original definitions maintained.

    [040326] Added  "filetype"  macro to  determine  the file type of  MS-DOS,
             Windows or UNIX.

    [040322] $mouse  variables  configured under console modes to allow pseudo
             mouse operations to be performed.

    [040322] Fixed the win32s  build and  emain.h  definitions.  Mouse was not
             supported   under   win32s   through   incorrect    configuration
             definition.

    [040322] Key  bindings  for the file  browser.  ENTER now  handled  on the
             reserved  fields  to sort.  BACKSPACE  now  moves up a  directory
             level.

    [040322] Changed the  interface  to cvs, ftp and  file-browser  command so
             that if a numeric  argument of 0 is given then the directory tree
             window is not opened, just the *files* buffer.

    [040322] AutoIt hook. Thanks to Dr Detlef Groth.

    [040322] Added CSS template. Thanks to Gabriel Tabares-Barreiro.

    [040318] Fix to Microsoft Windows clipboard when operating with VNC.

    [040317] Macro and source release set to "20040301".

    [040317] Added "find" command to macro set.

    [040317] Corrected  "rgrep" to use the  "%find-com" to specify the find(1)
             command.

    [040310] Fix to graphical diff ("gdiff").  Occasions where all changes had
             been   accepted  and  the  changes  could  not  be  saved.  gdiff
             incorrectly prompted user to accept all changes first.

    [040310] Support  for  multiple   comment  styles  in  the  same  language
             template.   Additional   comment   styles  are   defined  in  the
             "hkXXX.emf" file with the syntax ".fhook-XXX.comment-N" where "N"
             is an  integer  starting  for 1 to n,  the  number  of  different
             comment styles. Templates  updated to use multiple comment styles
             where appropriate (C, C++ and SQL).

    [040310] Support the 'r' flag in  ".fhook-XXX.comment"  flag field. Causes
             the key  binding to "esc-o" and "esc-q" to restyle  the  comment.
             All templates updated to include the flag where appropriate.

    [040310] CVS  operates   asynchronously  using  ipipes.  Refresh  problems
             resolved.

    [040310] narrow-search-forward  bound  to "C-c s",  narrow-search-backward
             bound to "C-c r".

    [040308] "ipipe-shell-command"  includes  additional  flag  to run in "raw
             mode"  where the buffer is not  annotated  and wrap is  disabled.
             Additional argument added to command to allow the "$buffer-ipipe"
             macro to be defined when the pipe is defined. Corrected operation
             of pipe-shell-command  where "ipipe" automatically  degrades to a
             "pipe" (Windows only), if degraded then the "$buffer-ipipe" macro
             is still invoked on completion.

    [040226] Deleted  "cygnus.emf"  added  "cygwin.emf"  for cygwin BASH shell
             support under Windows.  Corrected the shell  operation with macro
             layer for echo and completion.

    [040224] Add new 'narrow out unhilighted lines' feature.

    [040223] Add new buffer tab list  toolbar tool for rapid access to buffers
             via a top or bottom toolbar.

    [040223] Add <> buttons to toolbar mode lines to scroll left and right.

    [040223] Fixed. Calender day is off by one when going  backwards to before
             2004.

    [040223] Fixed.  Executing 'me' (user-setup -> Current) breaks  auto-spell
             until  a main  spell  command  (spell-word  or  spell-buffer)  is
             executed.

    [040223] CVS directory listing file loss solved.  Differences  between CVS
             command line  operations and directory list operations  resolved,
             both now produce the same results.

    [040229] Fixed UNIX signal lock synchronization, solves problems with read
             failing following FTP or HTTP command.

    [040223] Add   new   narrow-search-forward   and    narrow-search-backward
             commands.

    [040220] Mouse wheel operation fixed. Added new mouse-wup-scroll  commands
             that should be used instead.

    [040218] Added 'Invert Selection' to context menu.

    [040218] Add 'f5' refresh binding to a dir list buffer.

    [040218] Fixed. Need some way of opening the right mouse button menu using
             a key. Also need so  termcap  bindings  to open main and  context
             menus.  Created new  context-menu  command, bound to S-f1 and the
             windows  'menu' key (aka windows) and created  binds to open main
             menu (esc =) and context menu (esc +) on termcap platforms.

    [040217] Fixed.  '2   popup-window'   does  not  work  on  an   XTerm,  no
             implementation in function meFrameXTermMakeCur.

    [040217] Fixed. CVS status of  directories  is not shown. Also add 'b' and
             'o' file type flags.

    [040216] Fixed.  ME   build.bat   -l  options  do  not  work  in  standard
             cmd/command as there use 4DOS '>>&'  extension.  Changed to using
             2>&1 which works on cmd & 4nt but breaks 4Dos and command.

    [040216] Fixed   bottom   Toolbar   window   grows  when  CVS  is  opened,
             change-window-depth does not respect bit 2 of $window-flags.

    [040214] Added .spec template for RedHat RPM package file specification.

    [040214] Added .psf template for HP-UX depot product file specification.

    [040214] Recognize  -* makefile -*- and -* sh -*-

    [040213] Fixed reframe cvs-console better so the exit status can be easily
             seen from a small window.

    [040213] PHP script can be started with '<?' tag in a php file.

    [040213] Corrected  UNIX  ishell  operation  when  "su" to  another  user.
             Locking up or generally  behaving badly (termio not initialized).
             Affects all UNIX platforms.

    [040213] Documented the create/delete/next-frame keys.

    [040210] Fixed toolbar  Directory  File List does not contain "../" - UNIX
             only.

    [040210] Fixed. On UNIX only the $progname may not be fully  expanded (has
             just  "me")  which  may lead to a ctags  generation  error and an
             alternate fix to $search-path.

    [040210] Fixed. On unix,  find-file  of a symbolic  link which points to a
             directory  results  in a bad dir  listing.  The  list of files is
             correct but the stats are all wrong (found on sunos 5.8).

    [040210] Fix subtle ftp bug with alias ftp  addressed.  Create an ftp site
             "ftp://test/" say with user name foo and passwd bar and then load
             in  "ftp://test/dir1/"  the buffer file name is correctly  set as
             "ftp://test/dir1/" but the 'Directory listing of:' line is set to
             "ftp://foo@test/dir1/". Firstly the user may wish the 'foo' to be
             hidden but secondly with the  introduction of being able to click
             on the 'Directory  listing of:' line this has introduced a subtle
             inefficiency/bug,  if I  click  on the  'foo@test'  ME will  load
             "ftp://foo@test/"  not "ftp://test/"  which to ME is a completely
             different  file. This can in turn lead to  "ftp://foo@test/dir1/"
             being  loaded  so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being
             loaded! The fix is to make the  'Directory  listing of:' line the
             same, i.e. "ftp://test/dir1/"

    [040208] Fixed.  "-n"  command  line  option to a console  build  causes a
             option failure and the executable does not run.

    [040208] Corrected  UNIX jasspa tree search when  executable is in CWD and
             there is no executable path.

    [040206] RC4 - Release Candidate 4 - MicroEmacs '04

             revised and lookup simplified.

    [040203] "user-setup" changed name to "Rebind Home Keys" for re-binding of
             home and end keys to  start/end  of line.  Removed  "C-v" binding
             that existed with old "MS keys" label.

    [040203] Reworked all user defined defined  directory save locations, ftp,
             spell, etc..

    [040203] Corrected osf1, openBSD and zaraus emf files.

    [040203] Added "%cvs-com" variable to define the CVS command.

    [040203] XML template extended to include javascript.

    [040130] 2nd  iteration of prototype  and near final  revision of new user
             setup.

             Following  an internal  review of RC3 then it has been decided to
             address the issues of user configuration prior to a full release.
             This  specifically  addresses  the  location  of user  MicroEmacs
             configuration  directories  and search paths. User  configuration
             has  traditionally  required the setting of external  environment
             variables  such as "$MEPATH" and for the user to create a private
             directory to store user  settings. This is proving  difficult for
             new  users who just want to run the  editor.  RC4 and  subsequent
             releases will address these  problems by determining  the correct
             location for configuration files and create the appropriate files
             and directories under user control.

             The net result of these  changes  should  significantly  simplify
             installation and setup as follows:

             * All platforms will be able to run without any manual user setup
               or  the   requirement  for  specific   MicroEmacs   environment
               variables.

             * User  defined  directories  and  configuration  files  will  be
               created under editor control on detecting a new user.

             * Existing   installations   using   $MEPATH  will  be  backwards
               compatible with the new build.

             * All  platforms  now  support a searching  jasspa  sub-directory
               structure   of   company  /   spelling   /  macros.   This  was
               traditionally   limited   to   the   Windows   Install   Shield
               installation but has been extended across all platforms.

             * Two new  environment  variables are provided for user or system
               administrator use. "$MEINSTALLPATH" defines the location of the
               MicroEmacs  standard macros and allows the built in search path
               to be  overridden.  "$MEUSERPATH"  defines the  location of the
               user  private  configuration  directory  and allows the user to
               locate  their  private  directory  in different  location. In a
               standard install neither of these variables will be required.

             * The Microsoft  Windows system defined  application path will be
               used  for user  configuration  files.  This is  applicable  for
               roaming  users where the  application  directory is stored on a
               server.

             * The use of the me32.ini file on MicroSoft Windows  environments
               is not required, but is still supported.

             * The UNIX path searching is improved. /usr/local/microemacs will
               be depreciated and replaced with  /usr/local/jasspa in addition
               other  standard path  locations are supported on a per-platform
               basis.

             * On UNIX then the directory  "~/.jasspa"  shall contain the user
               configuration  files.  Optionally  the "company" / "spelling" /
               "macros"  sub-directories  may be  included  in this  directory
               where access to the system  directory  locations by the user is
               not permitted.

             * Concept of guest has been removed.  "guest.emf" and "guest.erf"
               removed   replaced  with  "newuser".   "user-setup"  no  longer
               supports setting of name.

             * Internal variables "$user-name" and "$user-path" are defined.

    [040128] Fixed re-style for C/C++ comments in vertical alignment.

    [040123] "user-setup" mouse button selection fixed.

    [040123] "C-x 3" mapped to "split-window-horizontally" , "C-x 5" mapped to
             "create-frame".

    [040122] Added support for Zaurus, thanks to Pierre Gaston

             operates correctly following a fold.

    [040119] "narrow-buffer"   numeric   argument  and  command  line  options
             extended for mark-up lines.

    [031026] Fixed  history  line numbers  (were one line out for  non-current
             buffers).

    [031026] Changed the  "mldelete" to respect the  "scrollFlag"  setting, if
             smooth scroll enabled then delete text smoothly.

    [031026] Fixed narrow look back highlight bug.

    [031026] Added ADA file hook - thanks to Gabriel Tabares-Barreiro.

    [031026] Nroff template. Removed unused variable.

    [031026] HTML Template. Major shake-up for HTML base files including major
             enhancements to indentation and current script auto-detection.

    [031026] Toolbar.  Added  support for the new ":chook"  current  file type
             variable  and got toolbar and buffer tool menu to call the update
             command (toolbar only on a "C-l").

    [031026] CVS. Fixed Unix checkout path and implemented cvs remove.

    [031026] Page-file. Fixed backward isearch blow out.

    [031026] Perl Template. Updated the perl.eaf to <FOLD>.

    [031026] Abbreviations.  Added  support for the new ":chook"  current file

    [031026] Abbreviations.  Improved  the  look-back  abbrev to expand to one
             before if exec'd again.

    [030917] HTML Template.  Fixed a hilighting  and indent  problem caused by
             embedded script.

    [030917] OSD.  Changed  OSD  hot-key  '&'  to  new  style  '\H'.   Changed
             user-setup dialog to use new Combo-box.

    [030917] CVS. Major revamp of CVS support including an OSD dialog for each
             tool.

    [030917] Changed the CHAR defines and add defines for the LEADER and TRAIL
             bytes used for special chars.  Re-implemented OSD hot-keys to use
             "\\H"  instead  of "&" and  added new "\\{" and "\\}" to stop and
             start  current  item  hilighting.  Added  support for C++ private
             public and protected token indentation. Added new Check-box chars
             to the extended chars  (1,2,3,4,19 & 20) and improved the drawing
             of some of the others Fixed windows "close while  minimized" test
             so only prompted if something has changed.

    [030917] Fixed a build.bat not setting MAKE to nmake problem.

    [030917] Added support for new Check-box chars in extended chars.

    [030827] Added use default printer setting.

    [030827] Page-file. Fixed header and added isearch support.

    [030821] Rationalized  the buffer sizes,  increased the keyboard macro and
             search string buffer sizes. Removed the GNU regex code - not used
             or tested in years. Part one of Jon's Xterm key lookup fix to get
             the key pad working.

    [030710] User  setup.  Updated  osd  calls  due to the  change in 'd' flag
             behaviour  and  changed the items with drop down menus to use the
             new combo-box.

    [030710] ODS. Updated osd calls due to the change in 'd' flag behavior.

    [030710] Added new  define  for the number of history  types and added new
             "@h" history variable.

    [030710] Added support to "@mn" and "@mna" in the "meGetKey" routine

    [030710] Added  new  undo  type  for  line  reordering   undo's,  used  by
             "sort-lines" and "transpose-line".

    [030710] Changed  some define names to make them  compatible.  Changed the
             calls to  "meGetUserKey" to "meGetKey" so a macro can give a list
             of keys Added new 0 argument  which  quits at the EOB rather than
             going to the top of the buffer etc (used in page-file "isearch").

    [030710] Changed  the  logic  of the 'd'  flag  so  that it  disables  the
             displaying of the item type, changed button  rendering so that it
             adheres to this so a single char button can be created  Added new
             'O' combo box item type  which is a mixture  between an entry box
             and a sub-menu item.

    [030710] Improved  the special  char drawing  routines so that they remain
             inside the char space and triangles look good regardless of size.

    [030710] Fixed a nasty bug to do with file hooks that load other files and
             the find-file command manipulating the buffHistNo  incorrectly so
             the wrong buffer is shown - obscure!

    [030625] Added macro release makefile.

    [030625] MicroEmacs 3.8 compatibility. Fixed isearch emulation.

    [030625] First revision of page-file.

    [030625] CVS. Removed debug line.

    [030610] Changed TAB and BELL to safer  defines.  Optimized  the fill-para
             function so that it keeps one of the existing  spaces between the
             words, this also help preserve the position of anchors.

    [030610] Package making files for SunOS.

    [030608] Changed the mouse default behavior to do a move yank.

    [030608] Tools. Removed superfluous endif.

    [030608] Toolbar.  Only  update the toolbar if its the top level  command,
             i.e. the screen-update is not required due to spell-buffer (say).

    [030608] MS-Shift  region. Check for  kill-rectangle  and treat like we do
             the kill-region.

    [030608] Added  new -ve  argument  to  insert-file  which  inserts  only a
             section of the file.  Optimized  the file-op  move command to try
             just moving the file first.

    [030608] Changed  the  addLine  function  so it  always  flags the line as
             changed,  this avoids some bizarre  issues when macros  delete an
             insert  lines  of text  (best  shown by the  buffer-info  toolbar
             tool).

    [030608] Added new macro oriented  buffer-info numeric argument. Fixed bug
             in the ignore white-space buffer compare.

    [030608] Fixed default printer selection issues - not complete.

    [030608] Fixed a minor debug build issue in undo.c.

    [030608] Changed the history so it always removes any duplicate entries.

    [030608] Added "$window-eline" and moved the aline into extended version.

    [030608] Changing  the  addLine  function  to always set the changed  flag
             meant all macros became hidden, use different bits.

    [030608] Fixed  buffer  reload a file while  displayed  in another  window
             problems.

             narrows.

    [030516] Stopped the Organizer Find exit quitting the organizer itself.

    [030516] VM Mail. Fixes from Tom Hundt fixes message separator problem.

    [030516] Made MS-DOS redraw the cursor on a poke as well.

    [030515] Organizer.  Fixed bugs with  creating new  addresses and indexing
             etc.

    [030515] Printer.   Store   the   windows   device   information   in  the
             print-history as well.

    [030514] JST  Template.  Fixed  jst magic  hook and added  Imakefile  one.
             Changed  jst magic  hook  variable  setting  setup to use the new
             $result variable.

    [030514] HTML   Template.   Changed   html-fold   ->  collapse,   reported
             goto-matching-tag failure.

    [030514] Buffer  initialization.  Changed the  fold-setup  call so that it
             gets  called if likely to be required - use the new  buffer-fhook
             $result setting to help in determining this.

    [030514] Folding.  Changed the  fold-setup so a setup string can be passed
             in  rather  than  searching  for  one  in the  buffer,  aimed  at
             utilizing the new buffer-fhook "$result" setting.

    [030514] Set  "$result" to the magic fhook  string so the fhook macro does
             not have to search for it again in buffer.c.

    [030514] Fixed "\xb" bad regex bug.

    [030513] Search. Added region line hilighting support.

             collapse.emf  and added a real folding editor support macros to a
             new fold.emf, based loosely on "fue".

    [030513] Abbreviation, Changed copy-region call to not expand the narrows.

    [030513] Latex Template. Added latex chars etc to the .eaf file.

    [030513] Search. Changed to handle the fold-open and fold-close split.

             use alpha mark.

    [030513] VM Mail. Regex protected the boundary id string.

             matching and added close tag feature.

    [030513] Buffer setup.  Changed fold -> collapse and added proper  folding
             setup entries.

    [030513] Commenting. Fixed silly "\\x80" alpha char label bug.

    [030513] File Dialogue. Added tab ordering to dialog.

    [030513] Folding all templates.  Changed the function  folding commands to
             collapse to avoid confusion with real folding.

    [030513] Mouse. Changed the column setting to use alpha marks.

    [030513] Color  Schemes.  Split  the  fold  scheme  into   fold-close  and
             fold-open.

    [030512] Fixed  display  matching  fence issue with poke screen hiding the
             cursor on Unix X-Windows. May need to be done on MS-DOS as well.

    [030512] Fixed  horrid crash caused in search.c by buffer  change in macro
             followed by query replace and toolbar up-date  changing the regex
             variables.

    [030512] Fixed fill-paragraph when no arg is given but at the beginning of
             para still move forward.

    [030512] Fixed compiler warning in spawn.c.

    [030512] Latest versions of build.txt, cygwin.txt, faq.txt and readme.txt.

    [030512] Build fix for SunOS.

    [030512] Ipipe fix for SunOS.

    [030512] Changedthe  line  flag  implementation  to be more  flexible  and
             variable in size so UE has a smaller memory usage and ME has line
             flags available.

    [030512] Improvedthe AMark setting and deleting.

    [030512] Added a Protected  Line flag and vastly  improved the  narrowing.
             Renamed most function in line.c to make them more readable.

    [030512] Big return value change to get functions  consistent - found that
             the return values of low level line functions  where different to
             high level functions  making the code hard to read and dangerous.
             Also needed a  consistent  triple  value  return  (true false and
             error) so change meABORT to -1 across the board.

             been annoying me for some time).

    [011220] Moved the  template  etfinsrt  calls  into the  buffer-initialize
             macro .

    [011220] Fixed the exec fhook-cpp not working .

    [011016] New caps-lock,  num-lock,  scroll-lock  and pause key support for
             win32  &  unix.  The  "*-lock"  implementation  to be  more  like
             "S-pick"  and  "C-pick" as the keys are  automatically  supported
             (like the shift) so there are no default  binds to void, the keys
             are only  generated if there are bound. Could not implement  this
             on MS-DOS.

    [011016] which  command  built  in i.e.  "M-x  which".  Used  for  command

             "SKEY_SPEC"  bits, pressing  return was like pressing 'N' so on a
             "Y/N" prompt try pressing return, its like saying No! .

    [011016] Spelling  dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because of
             the language changes, you need to rename your personal dictionary
             to lsdpengb.edf for British and lsdpenus.edf for American.

    [011016] Hilighting  brackets/braces  as  requested  from  user  base. The
             hilight   braces   required   some   other   subtle   changes  to
             screen-update and show-region and the addition of the "rbin" mode
             means that this version is incompatible  with the last in quite a
             few areas.

    [011016] Fixed  mouse  handler  (turns out that if the pick event was lost
             (use "@cg" or an error) then me would lock!).

    [011016] Extended  control on indent tab and return  behavior (can disable
             the tab behavior).

    [011016] C++ name space indentation support.

    [011016] New language support  interface so spelling is not required for a
             language to be supported (may only want the basic  alphabet setup
             etc).

    [011016] Changed file loading  interface so all commands (like  view-file)
             can load in "bin", "crypt" or "rbin" mode.

    [010123] Reduced binary mode added (rbin).

4th Release - August 2001

    [010813] OSD bug fix for fixed size dialog boxes.

    [010812] Inclusion of occur regexp function.

    [010812] List function for  summarizing  file contents ("F7" / "Esc-F7" to
             close).

    [010810] Rendered character for the scroll bar - improves clarity.

    [010810] Modified the printer registry file location.

    [010801] New Guest default color scheme.

3rd Release - Minor Updates July 14th 2001 onwards

    [010718] LaTeX template includes incorrect bindings - fixed.

    [010716] Corrected  Windows  Install  Shield  "Company  Entry" + "Registry
             entry fields".

    [010716] Minor macros  modification to font selection for schemes. Default
             guest setup font selection for cleaner 'first' page.

    [010716] CVS  macro  update.   Changed   "cvs-diff"  to  "cvs-gdiff"   and
             introduced  a new  "cvs-diff"  which just gives the "diff" output
             and fixed several bugs when running with a CVS server. Also added
             support for the CVS/Template file when committing.

    [010716] Minor  update  to  the  CVS  help  page  for  the  aforementioned
             (Affected all help files).

3rd Release - July 2001

    [010713] New style WWW JASSPA Pages.

    [010712] Added    comment   and   menu   support   for   MS-DOS   and   M4
             (hkdos.emf/hkm4.emf).

    [010711] Added hpux11 support.

    [010711] Fixed windows erase when file doesn't exist problems.

    [010710] Removed  cbox  -  replaced  by  generic  comment   implementation
             (cbox.emf/me.ehf).

    [010710] Added a 'Plain  Text'  char set  which  only uses  plain  letters
             (charset.emf).

    [010710] Fixed  many  little  comment   formatting   bugs  and  annoyances
             (comment.emf).

    [010710] Changes required to build on MS-DOS using DJGPP v1.

    [010705] Bug fix for windows rendering crash.

    [010630] Minor reorder to X-Windows initialization for cygwin X-Server.

    [010507] Added   generic   commands   for  the   creation,   deletion  and
             reformatting of comments now used by most of the file hooks.

    [010412] Added new generic  buffer  setup, menu and help macros,  creating
             the new  buffer-setup(3)  command. Ported all existing file hooks
             to this new interface greatly reducing the buffer hook size while
             increasing its functionality and consistency.

    [010402] Added support for new $buffer-backup(5)  variable for setting the
             back-up file location.

    [010312] Support  for  new key  bindings  allowing  CU  emulations.  Nedit
             bindings  provided as example.  Major work to enable the complete
             re-binding of all keys so the user interface to MicroEmacs can be
             completely  changed, this allows for example a Windows feel to be
             created. This  required many internal  ghosts to be exorcized and
             add new macro functions.

    [010308] User buffer configuration menu added.

    [010308] Improved Python support (Contribution PG).

    [010304] Bug fixes to hilighting logic.

    [010228] Improved dialog box for search/replace.

    [010210] Revised  programming  language  templates;  simplified the common
             elements used in configuring the templates.

    [010202] Added new  command-wait(2)  command to enable  macros to wait for
             user dependent completion, used in "gdiff".

    [010202] Changed     buffer     variables     to    except     the    form
             ":<buffer-name>:<variable>",  like command variables. This allows
             macros to access variable not defined in the current buffer.

    [010126] File "autosave" location changes. Control save name and location.

    [001005] OSD speedups.

    [001005] Improved and  increased  the file system  operations  via the new
             file-op(2) command, created better menus in the file-browser(3).

    [001010] Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more rationally.

    [001010] Improved ipipe-shell-command efficiency on Windows by introducing
             a new thread approach to listen for activity. Implemented a shell
             command-line in an ipiped environment so ishell(3) command is now
             usable on Windows platforms.

    [001010] Added  new  set-position(2)  which  can  be  used  to  store  all
             information about the current window and  goto-position(2)  which
             will  then  restore  them.  Allowed   macros  to  use  non-letter
             characters  for alpha marks and  positions so they no longer need
             to clobber user ones.

    [001010] Added new "-k" and "-u"  command-line  options and  improved "-s"
             option.

    [000922] Added GUI for tag dialog for tags generation.

    [000922] Recursive tags support (i.e. nested directory tag traversal).

    [000810] emain.h "#define"'s properly supported again so MicroEmacs can be
             successfully  compiled  without  options  like SPELL and OSD etc.
             This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%.

    [000718] Source trees now maintained under CVS.

    [000719] Improved TCL/TK and Perl template support.

    [000704] Improved FTP and HTTP support.

    [000620] Java tags support.

    [000503] Revised printer support.

    [000503] Color printer support (Lexmark).

    [000322] Minor fixes in the OSD.

    [000322] Reviewed the documentation  mode. A text description of the using
             the  documentation  modes is included in the  distribution in the
             text directory.

             (win32b55.mak).

    [000322] Support for Openstep 4.2 / NeXT Motorola 040 (Termcap only).

    [000322] Support for BSD 4.2/4.3.

    [000322] Revised UNIX Termcap support.

    [000322] New font rendering,  supporting bold, italic,  underline etc. All
             platforms   modified  to  cope  with  font  scheme   definitions.
             Platforms optimized for speed.

    [000126] Beta build revision contains version information for 2000/01/26.

    [000126] Directory  file copy. Within this release  files in the directory
             listings  may be selected for copy and pasting from the menu. Use
             the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory buffers.
             Copy and paste  to/from a ftp  directory  buffer to a local drive
             buffer  may be used to  initiate  an ftp  transfer.  (This is how
             these pages are uploaded).

    [000126] New  command ftp opens a ftp  connection  using a dialog. Use may
             save the host  connection  information  in a registry  file. Note
             that the password information is exposed so be careful where this
             is used - if in doubt do not enter the  password  and you will be
             prompted.

    [000126] New  command  "uniq"  operates as the UNIX of the same name. used
             with sort, and reduces to unique lines.

    [000126] Character  translation; addition of character  translation macros
             when  moving  between  character  sets.  Accessible  from Menu ->
             Format -> Change Buffer Char Set.

    [000126] Support for  additional  character  sets, Windows  GREEK, Windows
             TURKISH.

    [000126] Line  hilighting  selection  with the use of the  mouse  and auto
             search.  When  using  the  mouse  selection  to  set up the  line
             hilighting when invoked from a

             > right-mouse -> Hilight Line -> color/remove

             selection; the macro  determines  the mouse  selected  region and
             makes  an  appropriate  decision  as to how the  line  hilighting
             scheme is to be applied. The  following  rules apply to the mouse
             selection:-

             * Point in line  selected  (i.e. mark == point)  Hilight the line
               only.

             * Region  in the line  selected.  Both  point and mark are on the
               same line. Extract the selected text and hilight all lines that
               match the search  pattern. The color  "remove" is also  pattern
               matched to selectively remove lines.

             * Region  selected  mark & point on different  lines Block up the
               region with appropriate hilight.

             Notethat line hilighting may be safely used in a folded buffer.

    [000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may toggle this
             from the keyboard using a macro in your user.emf as follows:-

             > ; Macro to enable the display of TAB/CR. Note that we
             > ; force the screen to be updated.
             > define-macro tab-display
             > set-variable $system &bxor $system 0x80000
             > screen-update
             > !emacro
             > global-bind-key "tab-display" "f11"

    [000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf).

    [000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta.

    [000112] Revised color hilighting schemes, reduced the number of colors in
             a number of schemes.  Introduction  of the Sherwood  Forest color
             scheme (green theme obviously !!).

    [000112] Small  revision  to the  user  interface  with  respect  to  font
             selection. In order to make  character set selection  easier then
             the  multiple  choices for the box  characters  have been removed
             from Menu -> Help -> User Setup. These have been  replaced with a
             new check box  Extended  Char Set. This box  should be checked to
             enable  the  special  rendering  characters  and  enable  the box
             characters  -  this  is  typically   enabled  on  X-Windows   and
             MS-Windows.

    [000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name,  modification  time
             and size. Selecting the directory column title performs a re-sort
             based on the selection, a further selection reverses the order of
             the list.

    [000112] Addition of ftp support (meu build on Windows, enabled by default
             on UNIX).  Enables  files to be  edited  via ftp, (read and write
             supported).      Transfer     to     another     system     using
             ftp://[<user>[:<password]@]><host>[:<port>]/<pathname>.

    [000112] Improved  source code  provision for foreign  languages,  various
             internal  problems.  Support for Russian  (Windows  and  Cyrillic
             koi8-r).

    [000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date.

    [000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized wild card
             sequences. Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf, britishr.emf,
             etc.) then the following spelling rules may be added to cope with
             numeric  sequences.  The addition of these rules will spell check
             hexadecimal sequences and validate numeric sequences such as 1st,
             2nd, 3rd etc. A  spelling  of "1nd"  would  generate  a  spelling
             error.  This  has not  been  performed  for  other  languages  so
             submissions for other language equivalents would be appreciated.

             > ; Add some special word rules to make life easier.
             > ; These are for 1st, 2nd 3rd etc.
             > add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?1\\(st\\|ST\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?2\\(nd\\|ND\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?3\\(rd\\|RD\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*1[0-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*[04-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+"
             > ; Spell rules for unit definitions.
             > ; These are for 50Mb, 10Kg, -45.56cm 12ft 10.00am 16.00pm etc.
             > add-spell-rule "*" "-?\\([0-9]*.\\)?[0-9]+\\(Kg\\|Kb\\|Gb\\|Tb\\|Mb\\|mm\\|cm\\|m\\|Km\\|ft\\|inch\\|mph\\|lb\\|am\\|pm\\)"

    [000112] Box selection copy and paste. Bindings are defined as:-

             > Esc C-w kill-rectangle
             > Esc C-y yank-rectangle

    [000112] Enhanced  info file  hilighting  (Thanks to Dr. Detlef  Groth for
             this).

    [000112] New copy-file  command,  typically used by the macro language for
             moving files around.

    [000112] Error  reporting  of bad  command  line  arguments  in  Microsoft
             Windows environment (Thanks to Pedro Gomes for this).

2nd Release - November 1999

    [991101] Enhanced the latex support macros following various contributions
             from users.

    [991101] Added  Favorites  to the File  pull down  menu.  This is a simple
             mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites list.

    [991101] Ground  up  implementation  of  the  regular  expression  pattern
             matcher,  following  licensing  problems  with the GNU regex. The
             resultant  pattern  matcher is now a little faster than GNU regex
             and is capable of all of the standard regular  expression pattern
             matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that double
             backslashes  are required in the character  classes [..] to allow
             for escape sequence short cuts such as '\n' (newline), '\t' (tab)
             etc. It was felt that this  compromise  was better than having to
             quote the more obscure search characters.

    [991101] Changed  the  hilighting  and  indenting  syntax  to be GNU regex
             compliant.

    [991101] Modified  compare-windows  to  ignore  white  space  by  default,
             compare-windows-exact  performs an exact  character for character
             comparison.

    [991101] Enhanced the tags support to handle  multiple  tags and recursive
             directory tree searching.

    [991101] Implemented  osd-help,  a gui  front  end  to the  on-line  help.
             Required  changes to the help system which gives macros access to
             the on-line help buffer, needed for the index and search.

    [991101] Over-hauled the hilighting scheme files and editor to support the
             disabling of buffer hilighting.

    [991101] Many bugs fixed on all platforms, in particular  unix cutting and
             pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit delay.

    [991101] Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.

    [991101] Introduced message line variables "@mx" and "@mxa".

    [991101] New  Games  -  Crossword  cracker.  The  ideal  way to  cheat  at
             crosswords.  Uses the spelling  dictionary  to guess at the word,
             given a number of known letters.

    [991101] Hook  file  protection  against  globally  bound  keys - prevents
             re-binding of user defined keys within the macro.

    [991101] Search/Replace  fix for exact mode.  Environment  variable search
             path fix.

    [991101] hkm4.emf  added  back  into  the  release  (seemed  to have  gone
             missing).

    [991101] Cut and  paste  fix when  running  the UNIX  version  through  an
             X-Server such as Exceed in the Windows environment.

    [991101] Plain text printer device added.

    [991101] Obscure OSD fix.

    [991101] New OSD help search facility Menu->Help->General Help.

    [991101] Fix for NT  hang-up  on shut  down  (typically  encountered  when
             running a source debugger).

    [991101] Fix for NT process spawning with spaces in the names.

    [991101] Metris macro fix, OSD bug fix, NT display fix.

    [991101] New - color scheme, GVim look.

    [991101] New - Unix/Linux support for Wheel Mouse (mouse.emf).

    [991101] New - Color  schemes,  Plain;  for those  that do not care for an
             abundance of colors.

    [991101] Modified the numeric  key-pad  behavior to be  consistent  on all
             platforms.   Problems  were  noted  with  the  UNIX  number  lock
             orientation which was reversed.

    [991101] New - Color  scheme  variables  which  allow  the hkXXX  files to
             determine the level of hilighting to apply to their templates.

    [991101] Line  length fix; more  graceful  behavior  (i.e. does not crash)
             when the line length exceeds 64K.

    [991101] Intercept  the windows 105 keyboard  application  key  (typically
             right hand side of keyboard  next to the control key). The key is
             called  "menu". By default  this is bound in  win32.emf,  however
             users may bind it as a prefix for their own key  combinations  in
             much the same way as "Alt" or "C-x" if required.

    [991101] New; OMG's IDL language template added.

    [991101] Fix for windows short name in next-buffer.

2nd Release - Beta #1 - May 1999.

    [990501] Bug fixes with multi-language support and spelling dictionaries.

    [990501] Fixed  fill-paragraph such that it retains the cursor position in
             the paragraph when invoked without arguments.

    [990501] Moved to GNU regex for search/replace engine.

    [990501] Enhanced  isearch such that it operates in *shell[990501  buffers
             (again).

    [990501] gdiff  macro  implementation  of a graphical  diff to allow color
             annotation of  differences  and  difference  selection.  Uses the
             output of a standard diff(1) utility.

    [990501] 2nd port to IBM AIX.

1999

    [990101] Introduction  of the address and date  organizer  (replacing  the
             existing cal interface).

    [990101] Generic buffer folding using narrow-buffer .

    [990101] Rendered cursor support on all platforms. Smooth scrolling mode.

    [990101] Win32s port, for Microsoft 3.1/3.11 O/S.

    [990101] Re-worked  "translate-tcap-key"  to  generic  "translate-key"  to
             solve many of the foreign language problems.

    [990101] Re-worked  the ALT key mapping to allow  conventional  Emacs meta
