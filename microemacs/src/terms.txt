JASSPA's  MicroEmacs.  In  addition  contains  notes about the license
history and application.

1.0 License History

    JASSPA  MicroEmacs is derived from the  MicroEmacs 3.8 source base
    of  1998.  As  such,  all  of  the   software  has  been  under  a
    commercially  restrictive  license. JASSPA has upheld the original
    license  terms  laid down my the  original  author  and  copyright
    holder Danial M Lawrence.

    JASSPA is the collective  name given to the  maintainers of JASSPA
    MicroEmacs.  The current  maintainers  at the 1st January 2002 are
    Steven Phillips and Jon Green.

    On  Wednesday  19th  January  2001  JASSPA  applied  for,  and was
    granted,  permission  by  Danial  M  Lawrence  to move to the less
    restrictive  licensing  terms of GPL. As of 1st  January  2002 the
    JASSPA  distribution  of MicroEmacs  shall be supplied  under this
    licensing  arrangement. The licence is not transferable to earlier
    versions of the distribution or to the original program from which
    is was derived known as MicroEmacs.

    The original  copyrights are applied in ascending order to the GPL
    license and strictly honour the copyright forms presented below:-

 @      Copyright (C) 1988 Reginald Smith     [Single year]
        Copyright (C) 1987, 1989 Jom Barr     [Multiple years]
        Copyright (C) 1990-1995 Foo Bar       [Consecutive years]
        Copyright (C) 1996, 1998-2002 JASSPA  [Mult+Consecutive years]

    Where  the  original  author  has not  copyrighted,  then this may
    appear as the first entry  preceeding the copyrights with words to
    the effect 'Originally written by XXXX YYYYYY'.

    In  all  cases  the  original   copyright  should  be  maintained,
    authoring  history etc. must always be maintained but can be added
    to the 2nd comment block.

    The source  directory or parent MUST include the "LICENSE" file which
    contains the GPL license.

    So for example in main.c the existing header is defined as:-

>c>

3.0 Macro Files (.emf)

    Macro files are handled slightly  differently from the source code
    files. As the  files are  processed  at  runtime  then  there is a
    requirement to minimise the  information  that is contained in the
    file. In this case we make reference to LICENSE file that contains
    the fuller  licensing  and  copying  information,  which is always
    required. The  copyrights  are maintained as per the original file
    in the form laid out in section 1.0.

    In addition,  the synopsis,  authors and  additional  notes may be
    included following the short header.

    The macros  directory  or parent must  contain the "LICENSE"  file
    which contains the GNU license.
