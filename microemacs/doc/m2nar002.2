.TH CompanyProfiles 2
.XI CompanyProfiles - "Defining a company profile"
.SH "COMPANY PROFILES"
This section describes how a company profile should be incorporated into \*(mS. A company profile defines a set of
extensions to \*(mS which encapsulate settings which are used on a company wide basis. This type of configuration is
typically used with a networked (shared) installation. The company profile would typically include:-
.BS
Name of the company.
.BU
Standard header files including company copyright statements.
.BU
Standard file layouts
.BU
Company defined language extensions.
.BE 0
.SS "Location Of The Company Information"
It is suggested that all of the company extensions applied to \*(mS are performed in a separate directory location
which shadows the MicroEmacs standard macro file directory. This enables the original files to be sourced if a user
does not want to include the company files. This method also allows \*(mS to be updated in the future, whilst
retaining the company files.
.PP
The company files are generally placed in the \fCcompany\fR sub-directory described in the installation notes.
.SS "Content Of The Company Information"
.BP "Company macro file"
The company file is typically called by the company name (i.e. \fCjasspa.emf\fR) create a new company file. The file
includes your company name and hook functions for any new file types that have been defined for the company, an
example company file for \fBJasspa\fR might be defined as:-
.RS
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
