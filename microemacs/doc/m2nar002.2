.TH CompanyProfiles 2
.XI CompanyProfiles - "Defining a company profile"
.SH "COMPANY PROFILES"
This section  describes  how a company  profile  should be  incorporated  into
\*(mE. A company  profile  defines a set of  extensions  to  MicroEmacs  which
encapsulate  settings  which are used on a company  wide  basis.  This type of
configuration is typically used with a networked  (shared)  installation.  The
company profile would typically include:-
.BS
Name of the company.
.BU
Standard header files including company copyright statements.
.BU
Standard file layouts
.BU
Company defined language extensions.
.BE 0
.SS "Location Of The Company Information"
It is  suggested  that all of the  company  extensions  applied  to \*(mE  are
performed  in a separate  directory  location  which  shadows  the  MicroEmacs
standard macro file  directory.  This enables the original files to be sourced
if a user does not want to include the company  files. This method also allows
MicroEmacs to be updated in the future,  whilst  retaining the company  files.
.PP
The company  files are  generally  placed in the  \fCcompany\fR  sub-directory
described in the installation notes.
.SS "Content Of The Company Information"
.BP "Company macro file"
The   company   file  is   typically   called  by  the   company   name  (i.e.
\fCjasspa.emf\fR)  create a new company file. The file  includes  your company
name and hook  functions for any new file types that have been defined for the
company, an example  company file for \fBJasspa\fR might be defined as:-
.RS
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
