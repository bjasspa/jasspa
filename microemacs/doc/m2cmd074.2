.SH NAME
insert-macro \- Insert keyboard macro into buffer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B insert-macro
"\fIcommand\fR"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B insert-macro
inserts the named \fIcommand\fR into the current buffer in the \*(mS macro language, thus enables it to be saved,
re-load and therefore re-used at a later date. This is often used in conjunction with
.Ht start-kbd-macro 2 ,
.Ht end-kbd-macro 2
and
.Ht name-kbd-macro 2 .
The given \fIcommand\fR must have been defined either by a keyboard macro or in \*(mS macro code.
.SH NOTES
The \fBinsert-macro\fR provides a good method of identifying unknown low level key codes. Simply record the unknown
key as a macro and insert the macro into the scratch buffer. The low level key code appears within the string.
