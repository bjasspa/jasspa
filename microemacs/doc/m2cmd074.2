.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B insert-macro
"\fIcommand\fR"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B insert-macro
inserts  the named  \fIcommand\fR  into the current  buffer in the \*(mE macro
language,  thus  enables it to be saved,  re-load and  therefore  re-used at a
later date. This is often used in conjunction with
.Ht start-kbd-macro 2 ,
.Ht end-kbd-macro 2
and
.Ht name-kbd-macro 2 .
The given  \fIcommand\fR  must have been defined either by a keyboard macro or
in \*(mE macro code.
.SH NOTES
The \fBinsert-macro\fR provides a good method of identifying unknown low level
key codes. Simply  record the unknown key as a macro and insert the macro into
the scratch buffer. The low level key code appears within the string.
