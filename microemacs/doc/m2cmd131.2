.XI shell-command - "Perform an operating system command"
.SH NAME
shell-command \- Perform an operating system command
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.I n
.B shell-command
"\fIstring\fR"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shell-command
performs an operating system call with the given \fIstring\fR as its argument.
The command only fails if the shell-command call returns \-1. The
.Ht $result 5
variable is set the return or exit-code of the shell command and can be used to test the result.
.PP
The  argument  \fIn\fR  can be used to  change  the  default  behavior  of the
shell-command, \fIn\fR is a bit based flag where:-
.IP \fB0x01\fR
When set shell-command  waits for the command to complete, this is the default
behavior. When not set the command is launched and forgotten  about, the value
returned in
.Ht $result 5
will not reflect the exit code of the executed process itself.
.IP \fB0x04\fR
Disable the use of the command-line processor to launch the program (windows versions only). By default the
"\fBcommand\fR" is launched by executing the command:
.CS
    %COMSPEC% /c command 
.CE 0
.IP
Where \fC%COMSPEC%\fR is typically command.com. If this bit is set, the "\fBcommand\fR" is launched directly.
.IP \fB0x08\fR
Detach the launched process from \*(mS (windows versions only). By default the command is launched as a child process
of \*(mS with a new console. With this bit set the process is completely detached from \*(mS instead.
.IP \fB0x10\fR
Disable  the  command  name  mangling  (windows  versions  only). By default any
\&'\fC/\fR' characters found in the command name (the first argument only) are
converted to '\fC\\\fR' characters to make it Windows compliant.
.IP \fB0x20\fR
Displays the new process window (windows  versions  only), by default the window
is hidden.
.IP \fB0x100\fR
When set the command-line to be run is the first line of buffer  \fIstring\fR,
this feature can be used to overcome the default 1024  character  command-line
limit. When a multiple-line  command-line is required, a negative argument can
be given to
.Ht insert-string 2 .
.IP \fB0x200\fR
No wait  option,  when set the the  command  is run  without  waiting  for any
completion  status. This allows  processes to be run and then forgotten  about
e.g. a Word processor, Adobe Acrobat reader etc.
