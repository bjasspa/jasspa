.TH $buffer-major-mode 5
.XI $buffer-major-mode - "Define buffer major-modem"
.SH NAME
.Me "|$uffer-major-mode"
$uffer-major-mode \- Define buffer major-modem
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $uffer-major-mode
.I MajorModeId
.SH DESCRIPTION
The $uffer-major-mode variable defines the current buffer's active major mode. The variable cannot be directly set and
is largely redundant as it must be configured by calling
.Ht major-mode 2 .
Its main use is within macros which wish to ascertain what type of buffer it is
executing on, i.e. if a command was to be executed only on C files then the follow ensures that this is the case:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
!iif &not &seq $buffer-major-mode "c"  -8 ml-write "Error: Not a C file!"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
The variable and buffer's current major mode can be configured by calling \fBmajor-mode\fR or
.Ht buffer-setup 3 .
When a buffer first becomes active, the system uses the buffer's content and file name to determine the initial 
major-mode to apply, this in turn sets the initial value of this variable. See help on
.Ht major-mode 2
for more information on how this auto-assignment process works and is configured.
.SH NOTES
The value of this variable must stay in sync with the buffer's major-mode and the variable
.Ht $buffer-fhook 5 .
