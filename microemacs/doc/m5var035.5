.TH $random 5 
.XI $random - "Generate a random number"
.SH NAME
$random \- Generate a random number
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fC$random\fR \fIinteger\fR
.sp
0 <= \fIinteger\fR <= 16777215
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B $random
variable returns a random number in the range 0 - 16777215 (0x0ffffff) on reference to the variable.
.PP
The random number  generator  does not need seeding first as this is handled by \*(mS, any attempt to set the variable
will result in an error.
.PP
The range of the random  number  generator is fixed across all systems. The value is typically  capped to the required
range using the
.Ht &mod 4 
arithmetic  operator,  but  note  that  this  creates  a slight  biasing  if  16777216  is not a  multiple  of the cap
(there is a bias towards numbers less than the remainder, but this is generally ignorable).
.SH NOTES
\*(mS uses algorithm xoshiro128++ to generate 32 bit random numbers and then rotated right 8 bits to discard the least
significant byte and avoid negative numbers.
.PP
This should not be considered a cryptographically secure generator.
.SH EXAMPLE
In the following example, the returned value is used with the \fB&mod\fR operator to limit the value to a desired range:-
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
set-variable %random0to9 &mod $random 10
.CE 0
.Me $ehf-scheme
