.SH NAME
ml-write \- Write message on message line
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
\fI0\fR \fBml-write\fR
.br
\fIn\fR \fBml-write\fR "\fImessage\fR"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ml-write
writes the given  \fImessage\fR  to the message  line. If a positive  argument
\fIn\fR  is given  then there will be an \fIn\fR  millisecond  uninterruptible
delay, giving the user time to see the message.
.PP
If an argument of 0 is given to ml-write, the command clears the message line,
the message argument is not required. This is  useful so as not to
leave a confusing message from the last command(s) in a script. For example, a
callback  macro can  interrupt the user while they are using the  message-line
(entering a file name or searching a buffer etc),  executing \fC0  ml-write\fR
at the end of the callback macro ensures that the  message-line is restored to
the users current use.
.PP
.B ml-write
can also be used to write lines to \fIstandard out\fR and \fIstandard error\fR
by using a numeric  argument of \fI-1\fR or \fI-2\fR  respectively, a carriage
return  (\fC'\\n'\fR) is automatically  added to the  \fImessage\fR to create a
line.
.SH NOTES
A call to \fBml-write\fR  from a callback macro can erase a message line which
is currently being used (to enter a buffer name say). A call to
.Ht ml-clear 2
restores the previous message-line.
.PP
If the  argument  given  is not -1 or -2 calls  to  ml-write  are  ignored  in
standard \*(mS piped mode  (command-line  option  \fB-p\fR).  However they are
printed to standard error when debug piped mode is used  (command-line  option
\fB-P\fR),   making  the  debugging  and  maintenance  of  macro  based  piped
processing far easier. 
.PP The command \fBml-clear\fR used to be used to clear the message line, this
command was replaced by \fC0 ml-write\fR in December 2004.
.SH EXAMPLE
The  following  call  displays  a message on the  message-line  with a fixed 2
second pause:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
2000 ml-write "Hello World!"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
The following
.Ht start-up 3
macro  can be  used to add a  header  and  footer  line to a file  piped  into
standard in, writing the output to standard out.
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
define-macro start-up
    find-buffer "*stdin*"
    ml-write &spr "DEBUG: Read %d lines from stdin" $window-eline
    ml-write &spr "DEBUG: About to write header"
    -1 ml-write "<<<HEADER>>>"
    ml-write &spr "DEBUG: About to write body"
    0 save-buffer
    ml-write &spr "DEBUG: About to write footer"
    -1 ml-write "<<<FOOTER>>>"
    -2 ml-write &spr "%d lines written to stdout" &add $window-eline 2
    quick-exit
!emacro
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
To  run  this   example  save  this  macro  in  a  new  macro  file  (such  as
\fCmlwrite_test.emf\fR) and in a shell run:
.CS
cat input_file | me -n -p @mlwrite_test - > output_file
.CE
Note the \fCDEBUG\fR lines will be printed if \fB-P\fR option is used instead.
