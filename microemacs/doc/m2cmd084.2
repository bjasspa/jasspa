.SH DESCRIPTION
.B buffer-bind-key
creates a key  binding  local to the  current  buffer,  binding  the  command
\fIcommand\fR  to the keyboard input  \fIkey\fR. This command is particularly
useful in conjunction with file loading hooks (see
.Ht add-file-hook 2 )
allowing local key bindings dependent upon the context of the buffer.
.PP
The message line input is not effected by the current buffers local bindings.
.PP
.B buffer-unbind-key
unbinds a user  created  local key  binding,  this  command  effects  only the
current  buffer. If a negative  argument  is given to  \fBbuffer-unbind-key\fR
then all the current buffer's bindings are removed.
.SH NOTES
The prefix commands cannot be rebound with this command.
.PP
Key response time linearly increases with each local binding added.
