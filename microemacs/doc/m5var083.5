.SH NAME
$version \- \*(mS version date-code
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB$version\fR "\fIYYYYMMDD\fR"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB$version\fR  is a system  variable which is defined as the \*(mS build date
code. This value is fixed at compile  time and cannot be changed. The variable
may be used in macros to identify incompatibility issues.
.SH EXAMPLE
Given a macro  that only  operates  with a \*(mS  executable  built on or
after 1st August 2001 then this macro should check that  \fC$version\fR  is not
less than \fC20010801\fR. The check may be performed as follows:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
!if &les $version "20010801"
    ml-write "[Error: MicroEmacs executable is incompatible]"
    !abort
!endif
.CE 0
.Me $ehf-scheme
.SH NOTES
This variable was introduced in 2001-08-01, evaluating this variable on an
earlier  version  of \*(mS  would  return the string  "\fCERROR\fR"  unless an
environment  variable  $version  has  been  defined.  "\fCERROR\fR"  evaluates
to \fC0\fR hence the test still operates correctly.
.PP
This variable is used in the macro file  \fCme.emf\fR to check for any macro -
executable incompatibility issues.
