.SH DESCRIPTION
.B .calc.answer
is used to store the answer of the last successful calculation made by
.Ht calc 3 .
When defined the value will always be a number, but its format could be floating  point, or a binary, octal,  decimal
or hex integer depending on the output format requested in the sum.
.PP
The "\fIAns\fR" (Answer) in the next  calculation is substituted with this value.
.PP
.B .calc.result
is used to store the result of the last calculation made by
.Ht calc 3 .
This can be the same as \fB.calc.answer\fR,  a hybrid form of "\fB<floating-point> (<integer>)\fR" values when floating point and integer maths produce different
answers and the required  format is not  specified, or, if there is an error in the calculation string a \*(mS list with the first
element being the character offset to the point of error and the second element is an error message.
