.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB$fmatchdelay\fR \fIdelayTime\fR; Default is \fC2000\fR
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
The number of milliseconds to wait in a fence match  operation. When a closing
fence \'\fC)\fR' '\fC]\fR' or '\fC}\fR' is added the opening fence is searched
for,  scrolling  the  screen  up where  necessary,  this is the time  that the
opening fence is displayed, interruptible by typing any key.
.PP
When
.Ht cmode 2m
is enable the search algorithm used is '\fIC\fR' aware and if a matching fence
is not found then the bell is rung as a warning.  The  automatic  matching  of
fences can be enabled/disabled via the
.Ht fence 2m
mode.
.PP
A cursor can be moved to the matching fence using the
.Ht goto-matching-fence 2
command.
