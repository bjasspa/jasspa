.SH DESCRIPTION
.B kbd-macro-query
queries the termination  state of keyboard macro  recording. If the command is
executed  during  a  keyboard  macro  definition,  at that  point  during  its
execution the user is prompted as to whether to continue the macro  execution.
A reply of  "\fBy\fR"  continues  the  execution  as normal,  "\fBn\fR"  stops
execution at that point once, if executing  the macro  \fIn\fR times the macro
will  still  executed a further  \fIn-1\fR  times. If the  "\fC\*cg\fR"  abort
command is entered then all keyboard macro execution is aborted, regardless of
the number of repetitions.
