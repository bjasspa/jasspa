.SH DESCRIPTION
.B paragraph-to-line
is a variation of
.Ht fill-paragraph 2 .
.B paragraph-to-line
reduces  each of the next  \fIn\fR  paragraphs  of text to single  lines. This

single line allows the word processor to import the raw text file and keep the
text  within  paragraph  blocks. If the text is not  prepared  then all of the
line-feeds have to be manually deleted.
.PP
.B paragraph-to-line
allows text based documents to be prepared in \*(mS and imported into the word
processor at the final stage for formatting and layout.
.SH NOTES
