.XI printall - "Formatted print job"
.SH NAME
printall \- Formatted print job
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
\fBme\fR "@printall" \fI<files>\fR
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
The start-up file  \fCprintalls.emf\fR  may be invoked from the command line to
generate a print job for each file specified on the command line.
.PP
Given  a list  of  \fI<files>\fR,  the  files  are  loaded  into  the  editor,
and then printed through \*(mS printing formatter. This is an alternative to 
.Hr cgrind 1 
or some other syntax smart \fIpretty print\fR filter.
.PP
The operation of this macro assumes that the printer is functioning correctly.
.SH BUGS
As a guess, I would  probably bet that this does not work very well on Windows
as a dialog is invoked for the print.
