.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBf90\fR file type  templates provide simple hilighting of Fortran 77 and
Fortran 90 files, the template  provides  minimal  hilighting of both language
syntaxes, which are overloaded into the same file.
.PP
The major  difference  between  the file  types,  apart from the new  reserved
words, is the  comments. In Fortran 90 comments are  introduced  with  \fB!\fR,
while the other types use a \fBc\fR in column 0.
.SH BUGS
The Fortran hilight file is in it's infancy and a number of it's tokens may be
misplaced.
