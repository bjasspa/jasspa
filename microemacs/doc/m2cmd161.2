.SH INTODUCTION
A  \fBframe\fR  in \*(mS is the screen  canvas on which all of the windows are
attached.  \*(mS allows the  creation of new frames which  creates a new blank
canvas which is can then be populated with new windows. Frames may be swapped
and when swapped the window layout for a given frame is preserved until the
frame is displayed again. There are two types of frame:
.IP Internal
An internal frame uses the same OS window or console hiding any other frames.
This means that any existing  frame is hidden and a new frame blank takes
its place. Internal frames are supported on all platforms.
.IP External
An external frame creates a new OS window allowing both the original frame and
new  frame to be  visible  in  different  windows.  External  frames  are only
available under windowing  platforms such as X-Windows and Microsoft  Windows.
External frames may also be paged with internal frames.

This is shown in the following diagram:-

.CE
The user may move to the next frame using
.Ht next-frame 2
which swaps the current frame for the next frame. External  frames may also be
accessed via the window manager by selecting the window.
.PP
A frame may be subsequently deleted with
.Ht delete-frame 2 .
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcreate-frame\fR  creates a new frame for the current \*(mS session, the new
frame is assigned a unique identity 
.Ht $frame-id 5 
which exists for the life of the frame.
.PP
The numeric  argument  \fIn\fR  defines the type of frame to be created. If an
argument  of \fC1\fR is given (the  default  argument)  an  external  frame is
created. An internal frame is created with an argument of \fC0\fR.
.SH NOTES
\*(mS is not  multi-threaded  and only one frame may be active at any one time
(the  complexity  of being able to run a command in one frame while editing in
another  would rapidly lead it away from the 'Micro'  status). This means that
if a command is left  active  (such as a search) in one frame and the focus is
changed  to  another  the input is  \fIsent\fR  to the frame  with the  active
command and the message \fC[NOT  FOCUS]\fR  appears in the message-line of the
frame with the OS focus.
.PP
\fBcreate-frame\fR  is useful in macros  that rely on a window  layout, as the
macro can preserve the users current  window layout by creating a new internal
frame in which to run.
