.SH DESCRIPTION
The standard assembler file extensions  \fB.s\fR and \fB.asm\fR are by default
not bound to any hook functions as they are platform specific. The user should
define a default  binding for the assembler  file types as  appropriate to the
current platform and assembler  development. i.e. for the Windows  environment
the
.Ht x86 9
file type would be conditionally bound to the file e.g.
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
!if &seq $platform "win32"
    add-file-hook ".s .asm"             fhook-asmx86
!endif
