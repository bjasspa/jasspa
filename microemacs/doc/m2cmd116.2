.SH DESCRIPTION
.B search-forward
searches for a string from the current cursor position to the end of the file.
The string is typed on the bottom line of the screen, and terminated  with the
\fC<ESC>\fR  key. Special  characters can be typed in by preceding them with a
\fC^Q\fR. A single \fC^Q\fR  indicates a null string. On successive  searches,
hitting \fC<ESC>\fR alone causes the last search string to be reused.
.PP
Searching is affected by
.Ht magic 2m
mode, which allows regular  expression  pattern
matching, and
.Ht exact 2m
mode which makes the search case sensitive.
.PP
The numeric argument
.I n
is interpreted as follows:-
.IP "\fBn > 0\fR"
The \fIn\fRth occurrence of the \fIstring\fR is located.
.IP "\fBn < 0\fR"
The first occurrence of the \fIstring\fR is located in the next \fIn\fR lines.
.PP
.B search-forward
does not search through text that is hidden with
.Ht narrow-buffer 2 .
Where a search through hidden regions is required then
.Ht narrow-search-forward 3
should be used instead.
.PP
.B search-backward
searches  backwards in  the file.  In all  other ways  it is like
.BR search-forward .
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The command returns a status of \fCFALSE\fR if the  \fIstring\fR  could not be
located (or \fIn\fRth  \fIstring\fR where \fIn\fR  occurrences are requested).
If the  \fIstring\fR  is found  within the given  search  criteria  the return
status is \fCTRUE\fR.
