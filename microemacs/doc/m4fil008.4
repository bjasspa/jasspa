.SH DESCRIPTION
The conditional directives allow statements to be executed only if a condition
specified in the directive is met, as follows:-
.BS 1 1
Every line following the \fB!if\fR
directive, until the first \fB!elif\fR, \fB!else\fR or \fB!endif\fR directive,
is only executed if the expression following the \fB!if\fR directive evaluates
to a \fCTRUE\fR value (non-zero).
.BU
If the \fB!if\fR evaluates to \fCFALSE\fR and a \fB!elif\fR  directive is next
then the  expression  following  the  \fB!if\fR  is  evaluated  and  following
statements are executed if \fCTRUE\fR.
.BU
If no \fB!if\fR or  \fB!elif\fR is found to be \fCTRUE\fR and a \fB!else\fR is
found then the statements following it are executed.
.BE
The \fIcondition\fR may be any logical condition as evaluated by the
.Hl "variable functions" Functions -
(e.g.
.Ht &equal 4 )
returning  \fCTRUE\fR or  \fCFALSE\fR.  An integer value,  non-zero  evaluates
\fCTRUE\fR, zero evaluates to \fCFALSE\fR. A non-numerical argument, such as a
string is always \fCFALSE\fR.
.PP
The  \fIconditional  body\fR may be any  \fB\*(mS\fR  function,  macro or
directive  with the exception of  \fBdefine-macro\fR  and  \fB!emacro\fR.  All
directives that alter the execution of the macro are handled  correctly within
the \fB!if\fR statement (e.g.
.Hl !goto !goto 4 ,
.Hl !return !return 4
etc).
.PP
\fB!iif\fR provides an optimal way to write an \fB!if\fR statement with exactly one \fIbody\fR line and no \fB!elif\fR
or \fB!else\fR statements.
.SH EXAMPLE
The  following  macro  segment  creates the
portion of a text  file automatically.  (yes believe  me, this will be
easier to understand then that last explanation....)
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
!if &sequal %curplace "timespace vortex"
    insert-string "First, rematerialize\\n"
!endif
!if &sequal %planet "earth"	;If we have landed on earth...
    !if &sequal %time "late 20th century"  ;and we are then
        ml-write "Contact U.N.I.T."
    !elif &sequal %time "pre 20th century"
        ml-write "start praying for a miracle"
    !else
        insert-string "Investigate the situation....\\n"
        insert-string "(SAY 'stay here Sara')\\n"
    !endif
!else
    set-variable %conditions @ml"Atmosphere conditions outside? "
    !if &sequal %conditions "safe"
        insert-string &cat "Go outside......" "\\n"
        insert-string "lock the door\\n"
    !else
        insert-string "Dematerialize..try somewhere else"
        newline
    !endif
!endif
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
The first \fB!if\fR statement in the above example can be optimised to:- 
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
!iif &sequal %curplace "timespace vortex"  insert-string "First, rematerialize\\n"
.CE 0
.Me $ehf-scheme
.SH NOTES
There is a convention in \fB\*(mS\fR macro code of using 2 spaces to separate the \fIcondition\fR  from the \fIbody\fR
of an \fB!iif\fR statement making it easier to locate the start of the \fIbody\fR.
