.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pipe-shell-command
executes one operating  system command  \fIcommand\fR  and pipes the resulting
output into a buffer with the name of \fB*command*\fR. The
.Ht $result 5
variable is set the return or exit-code of the shell command and can be used to test the result.
.PP
The  argument  \fIn\fR  can  be  used  to  change  the  default   behavior  of
pipe-shell-command described above, \fIn\fR is a bit based flag where:-
.IP \fB0x01\fR
Enables the use of the default buffer name \fB*command*\fR  (default). If this
bit is clear the user must supply a buffer name. This enables  another command
to be started without effecting any other command buffer.
.IP \fB0x02\fR
Hides the output  buffer,  default  action pops up a window and  displays  the
output buffer in the new window.
.IP \fB0x04\fR
Disable the use of the command-line processor to launch the program (windows versions only). By default the
"\fBcommand\fR" is launched by executing the command:
.CS
    %COMSPEC% /c command 
.CE 0
.IP
Where  \fC%COMSPEC%\fR  is  typically  command.com.  If this  bit is set,  the
"\fBcommand\fR" is launched directly.
.IP \fB0x08\fR
Detach the launched process from \*(mS (windows versions only). By default the command is launched as a child process
of \*(mS with a new console. With this bit set the process is completely detached from \*(mS instead.
.IP \fB0x10\fR
Disable the command name mangling (windows versions only). By default any \&'\fC/\fR' characters found in the command
name (the first argument only) are converted to '\fC\\\fR' characters to make it Windows compliant.
.IP \fB0x20\fR
Displays the new process window (windows versions only), by default the window is hidden.
.IP \fB0x40\fR
Raw mode, disable text annotation at the start of the pipe output.
.IP \fB0x80\fR
Not used by this command.
.IP \fB0x100\fR
When set the command-line to be run is the first line of buffer  \fIstring\fR,
this feature can be used to overcome the default 1024  character  command-line
limit. When a multiple-line  command-line is required, a negative argument can
be given to
.Ht insert-string 2 .
.IP \fB0x200\fR
Not used by this command.
.IP \fB0x400\fR
When this bit is set the command sets the value of the given  \fIvariable-name\fR  to the output of the shell  command
rather than insert it into a buffer. Note that the output length is limited to the maximum variable length,  typically
1024 or 2048 bytes, and the output is copied verbatim so a '\fC\\0\fR' in the output will terminate the value.
.SH NOTES
On \s-1MS-DOS\s0 and \fIWin32s\fR the standard shell
.Hr command.com 1
does not support the piping of \fIstderr\fR to a file. Other shells, such as
.Hr 4Dos.com 1 ,
do, using the command-line  argument  "\fC>&\fR". If the environment  variable
"\fCME_PIPE_STDERR\fR"  is defined (the value is not used) then \*(mS  assumes
that the current shell supports piping of stderr.
