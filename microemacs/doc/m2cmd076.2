.SH NAME
insert-string \- Insert character string into current buffer
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.I n
.B insert-string
"\fIstring\fR"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B insert-string
inserts a string  \fIn\fR  times into the  current  buffer,  moving the cursor
position.
.PP
.B insert-string
allows  text to be  built in a buffer  without  reading  it from a file.  Some
special escape characters are interpreted in the \fIstring\fR, as follows:
.IP
.nf
.na
\fC\\n\fR \- Enters a new line
\fC\\t\fR \- A tab character
\fC\\b\fR \- Backspace
\fC\\f\fR \- Form-feed
\fC\\\\\fR \- Literal backslash character '\fC\\\fR'
\fC\\xXX\fR \- Hexadecimal value of character \s-1ASCII\s0 value
.ad
.fi
.SH "NOTES"
If a  negative  argument  \fIn\fR  is given to  \fBinsert-string\fR  the given
string is inserted  0-\fIn\fR  times into the buffer. The behavior is the same
as if a  positive  argument  is given  except  that if the  string  contains a
new-line  character  (ascii char 0x0a), rather than  splitting the string over
multiple lines the character is inserted into a single line of the buffer.
.PP
This is highly  irregular  and can break \*(mS (for example
.Ht undo 2
will fail and could lead to a crash);  the  feature  has been added to support
bit \fC0x100\fR of the
.Ht shell-command 2
process  spawning group of commands. It's use outside of this context is to be
avoided.
