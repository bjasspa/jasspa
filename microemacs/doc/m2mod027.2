.SH NAME
save \- Flag buffer to be saved
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "save Mode"
.sp
\fBS\fR \- mode line letter.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This mode cannot be set  globally  and can only be set on a buffer which needs
saving.  The mode is used to flag that the buffer is to be saved, the state of
the mode is displayed in the output of
.Ht list-buffers 2 .
If the second column is an 'S' the mode is set,  otherwise  it is not. Only the
execute command in 
.Ht list-buffers 2
(bound  to 'x') uses this flag to  actually  save the  buffer  and the flag is
automatically removed as soon as the buffer is saved.
