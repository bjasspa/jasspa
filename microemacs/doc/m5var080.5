.TH $trunc-scheme 5
.XI $trunc-scheme - "Truncation color scheme"
.SH NAME
$trunc-scheme \- Truncation color scheme.
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB$trunc-scheme\fR \fIschemeNum\fR; Default is \fC0\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B $trunc-scheme
sets the color scheme used when drawing a line truncation  indicator. The left
truncation character (usually a '\fC$\fR' char) drawn at the start of the line
indicates that the line has been scrolled to the right and therefore the start
of the line has been  truncated.  A right  truncation  char  (also  usually  a
\&'\fC$\fR')  drawn at the end of the line indicates the remainder of the line
is too long to fit onto the width of the window so the end has been  truncated
and the indicator drawn.
.PP
The \fIschemeNum\fR selected must be a color scheme defined with
.Ht add-color-scheme 2 ,
which identifies the foreground and background color schemes. A hilight scheme
can define its own truncation color scheme, see
.Ht hilight 2
for more information.
.SH "NOTES"
The truncation characters used are set by the
.Ht $window-chars 5
variable.
