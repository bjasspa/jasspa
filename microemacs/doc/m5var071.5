.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
\fB$delay-time\fR \fImilliseconds\fR; Default is \fC500\fR

\fB$repeat-time\fR \fImilliseconds\fR; Default is \fC25\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB$delay-time\fR sets the time waited between the user picking a mouse button
and the  generation of a  \fCmouse-time-?\fR  key event.
.PP
When user  presses  the left  button (say) a  \fCmouse-pick-1\fR  key event is
generated,  If this key is bound then the command it is bound to is  executed.
If the  user  then  holds  down  the  button  for  \fB$delay-time\fR  or  more
milliseconds  then \*(mS checks the binding of the special  \fCmouse-time-1\fR
key, if this  pseudo  key is  bound  then the  command  it is bound to will be
executed.
.PP
If the user continues to hold down the button for a further \fB$repeat-time\fR
milliseconds  another  \fBmouse-time-1\fR  key  event  will  be  generated.  A
\fBmouse-time-1\fR key event will be generated after every  \fB$repeat-time\fR
milliseconds   until  the  user   releases   the  button,  at  which  point  a
\fCmouse-drop-1\fR key event is generated.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example implements the vertical scroll-bar up and down scrolling
arrows for a buffer window:-

    !if &equ &band $mouse-pos 15 5
        ml-write "Mouse on up-arrow"

        1 global-bind-key scroll-up "mouse-time-1"
    !elif &equ &band $mouse-pos 15 9
        ml-write "Mouse on down-arrow"
        1 scroll-down
        1 global-bind-key scroll-down "mouse-time-1"
