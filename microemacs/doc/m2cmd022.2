.SH NAME
copy-region \- Copy a region of the buffer

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBcopy-region\fR \*(C0

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B copy-region
copies all the characters between the cursor and the mark set with the
.Ht set-mark 2
command into the kill buffer (so they can later be
.Hl yanked yank 2 
elsewhere).
.PP
If the last command also entered text into the kill buffer (or the
.Ht @cl 4
variable  is set to one of  these  commands)  the  \fBcopy-region\fR  text  is
appended to the last kill.
.PP
The numeric argument \fIn\fR determines how the copy operates when a narrow region, defined by 
.Ht narrow-buffer 2 ,
is  encountered.  The default  operation,  when the number  argument is \fC1\fR, is to copy all of the text  contained
within the narrowed  region. When the numeric  argument is \fC0\fR then narrowed  region is NOT copied and the text is
copied as it appears in the buffer.
.PP
If a negative  argument is given, the current  current region is not copied, instead the current kill buffer is copied
to the system clipboard (Windows only).
.SH USAGE
To copy text from one place to another, using the  \fBcopy-region\fR  command,
the following operations are performed:
.BS
Move to the beginning of the text you want to copy.
.BU
Set the mark there with the
.Hl set-mark set-mark 2 
(\fBesc-space\fR) command.
.BU
Move the point (cursor) to the end of the text.
.BU
Use  \fBcopy-region\fR  to copy the region you just  defined. The text will be
saved in the kill buffer. (If you accidentally delete the text use
.Hl yank yank 2 
(\fB\*cy\fR) immediately or
.Hl undo undo 2 
(\fB\*(cXu\fR) to restore the text).
.BU 
Move the point to the place you want the text to appear.
.BU
Use the
.Hl yank yank 2 
(\fB\*cy\fR)  command  to copy the text  from the kill  buffer to the  current
point.
.BE
Repeat the last two steps to insert further copies of the same text.
.SH NOTES
Windowing systems such as X-Windows and Microsoft Windows utilize a global windowing kill buffer allowing data to be
moved between windowing applications (\fIcut buffer\fR and \fIclipboard\fR, respectively). Within these environments
\*(mS automatically interacts with the windowing systems kill buffer, the last \*(mS \fBcopy-region\fR entry is
immediately available for a paste operation into another windowing application.
.PP
The numeric argument \fIn\fR was introduced in the '04 release.
