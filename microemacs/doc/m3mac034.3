.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBishell\fR  creates an  interactive  shell  window  within the a  MicroEmacs
buffer window, providing access to the native operating systems command shell.
Within the window commands may be entered and  executed, the results are
shown  in the  window.
.PP
On running  \fBishell\fR a new buffer is created  called  \fC*shell*\fR  which
contains the shell.  Executing  the command  again  creates a new shell window
called \fC*shell1*\fR, and so on. If a \fC*shell*\fR window is killed off then
the available window is used next time the command is run.
.PP
Additional  controls  are  available  within the shell  window to control  the
editors interaction with the window. The operating mode is shown as a digit on
the buffer mode line (2/3/4) which is defined in the  following  sections. The
operational mode is changed with the \fBF3\fR function key.
.IP "\fBMode 2 - Browse Mode\fR"
Locks the  window  and allows  local  editing to be  performed.  All  commands
entered  into the window are  interpreted  by the editor. Mode 2 is  typically
entered to cut and paste from the window, search for text strings etc. In mode
2, a \fB2\fR is shown on the mode line.
.IP "\fBMode 3 - Semi-immersion\fR"
The  normal  operating  mode, text typed into the window is  presented  to the
shell window. Translation of MicroEmacs commands (i.e.  beginning-of-word) are
translated  and passed to the shell. For  interactive  use this is the default
mode. In mode 3, a \fB3\fR is shown on the mode line.
.IP "\fBMode 4 - Full Immersion\fR"
All input is passed to the shell, no MicroEmacs  commands are  interpreted and
keys are passed  straight to the shell window. This mode is used where none of
the keys to be entered are to be interpreted by MicroEmacs. Note that you have
to un-toggle mode 4 before you can swap buffers as this effectively  locks the
editor into the window.
.\".IP \fBF5\fR
.\"Clears  the  buffer  contents.  This  simply  erases  all  of  the  historical
.\"information in the buffer. The operation of the shell is unaffected.
.LP
To exit the shell then end the shell  session  using the normal  exit  command
i.e.  "\fCexit\fR" or "\fCC-d\fR" as normal and then close the buffer. A short
cut  "\fCC-c C-k\fR" is  available  to kill off the pipe.  However, it is not
recommended that this method is used as it effectively performs a hard kill of
the buffer and attached process.
.SH UNIX
The UNIX  environment  uses the  native  \fBpty\fR  support  of the  operating
system.  The  shell  that  is  opened  is   determined  by  the   conventional
\fC$SHELL\fR environment variable.
.PP
The shell window assumes that the user is running some sort of Emacs emulation
on the command line (i.e. \fCVISUAL=emacs\fR for
.Hr ksh 1 ,
.Hr zsh 1 ,
.Hr bash 1 ,
.Hr tsch 1 )
and passes Emacs controls for command line editing.
.PP
The  shell  window  understands  re-size  operations  and  provides  a limited
decoding of the  \fItermio\fR  characters  for a VT100 screen. From within the
shell window it is possible to run the likes of
.Hr top 1
correctly.  It is even possible to run another MicroEmacs terminal session !!
.SH WINDOWS
The Windows  environment  provides a very poor command shell facility, this is
more of a fundamental  problem with the operating  system than anything  else.
Unfortunately  NT/2K/XP are no better than Windows '95/'98,  stemming from the
fact that  Microsoft  Windows is actually a huge Window  Manager  (hindered by
legacy issues of MS-DOS).
.PP
For those familiar with the UNIX command shell then it is strongly recommended
that the
.Ht cygwin 3
\s-1BASH\s0  shell is used as an  alternative.  This is a far more  responsive
shell window and provides the familiar Emacs editing of the command line.
.PP
The command shell under Microsoft Windows is slow and very  unresponsive, this
would appear to be a problem with the  \fIcommand.com\fR  as the same problems
are not apparent with the
.Hl cygwin cygwin 3
environment.  However, the shell  window is good for kicking off command  line
utilities  (such as \fImake\fR) or any command line  processes  that generates
output on  \fIstdout\fR  as all of the output is captured in the buffer window
which can be scrolled  backwards for post analysis. For this very reason it is
more preferable to a standard MS-DOS box.
.PP
It is not  possible to run any  utilities  that use  embedded  screen  control
characters as these are not interpreted by the editor.
.SS "Changing the Shell"
The default shell that is executed is defined by the environment variable
.BR $COMSPEC .
Where the user is using a different  command shell (i.e. 4-DOS), then problems
may  arise if this is an old  16-bit  executable.  The shell  that  MicroEmacs
executes may be overridden by setting the environment variable
.BR $ME_ISHELL .
This is typically set in the user or company setup macro file, see
.Ht user-setup 3 .
.SS "Bugs"
.IP "\fBWinOldAp\fR"
.B Winoldap
is  created  by the  Microsoft  environment  whenever a shell is  created.  On
occasions  where  processes have terminated  badly the user may be prompted to
kill  these off; this is the  normal  behaviour  of  Windows.  It is  strongly
advised that the shell is always exited  correctly  (i.e.  \fCexit\fR)  before
leaving  the  editor.  The  Windows   operating  system  for  '95/'98  is  not
particularly  resilient to erroneous  processes and can bring the whole system
down. NT/2K/XP do not appear to suffer from these problems (so much).
.IP "\fBLocked Input\fR"
There are  occasions  after  killing a process the editor  appears to lock up.
This is typically a case that the old application has not shut down correctly.
Kill off the erroneous task  (\fCAlt-Ctrl-Del\fR  - \fIEnd Task\fR) then bring
the editor under control using a few \fCC-g\fR
.Ht abort-command 2
sequences.
.SH NOTES
The \fBishell\fR command uses the
.Ht ipipe-shell-command 2
to manage the pipe between the editor and the shell. The window is  controlled
by the macro file  \fChkipipe.emf\fR  which controls the interaction  with the
shell.
