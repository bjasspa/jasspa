.XI get-registry - "Retrieve a node value from the registry"
.XI set-registry - "Modify a node value in the registry"
.SH NAME
set-registry \- Modify a node value in the registry.
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
\fBset-registry\fR "\fIroot\fR" \fI"subkey\fR" \fI"value\fR"
.br
\fI2\fR \fBset-registry\fR "\fIroot\fR" \fI"new-name\fR"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B set-registry
adds (or modifies) a new value to the registry.  \fIroot\fR is the root of the
new entry and  \s-1MUST\s0  exist or the call fails.  \fIsubkey\fR is the node
name (or path) if the path does not exist then it is created.  \fIvalue\fR  is
the value to assign to the node.
.PP
If a numeric  argument  of 2 is given the  \fIroot\fR  is renamed to the given
\fInew-name\fR;   the  \fIroot\fR  must  exist  or  the  call  fails.  If  the
\fInew-name\fR  contains a path (i.e.  "new/path/name")  the registry  node is
moved  to the new path  which  must be an  existing  absolute  path,  i.e. not
relative to its current location.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following call
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
set-registry "/history" "foo/win32/printer" "foo-bar"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
constructs a registry hierarchy of the form:-
.CS
"history" {
  "foo" {
    "win32" {
      "printer"="foo-bar";
    }
  }
}
.CE
The value of the registry node may be retrieved using:-
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
&reg "/history" "foo/win32/printer"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
which would return "\fCfoo-bar\fR".
.SH NOTES
The  \fBget-registry\fR  command  was  removed in January  2005 as  \fB&reg\fR
should be used.
