.SH NAME
set-registry \- Modify a node value in the registry.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
\fBset-registry\fR "\fIroot\fR" \fI"subkey\fR" \fI"value\fR"

\fI2\fR \fBset-registry\fR "\fIroot\fR" \fI"new-name\fR"

.SH INTRODUCTION
The  \fIregistry\fR  is a  hierarchical  tree of node  names  optionally  with
associated  node  values that is used for storing and  retrieving  values. The
registry  mechanism  is  used  for  saving  and  retrieving   persistent  user
information between sessions.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B set-registry
adds a new value or modifies an existing value in the registry.  \fIroot\fR is
the  root  of  the  new  entry  and  \s-1MUST\s0  exist  or  the  call  fails.
\fIsubkey\fR  is the node name (or `\fC/\fR'  separated  path) if the nodes in
the path do not  exist  then  they are  created.  \fIvalue\fR  is the value to
assign to the node.
.PP
If  a  numeric  argument  of 2 is  specified  the  \fIroot\fR  is  renamed  to
\fInew-name\fR,   the  \fIroot\fR  must  exist  or  the  call  fails.  If  the
\fInew-name\fR contains a path (i.e.  "\fCnew/path/name\fR") the registry node
is moved to the new path  which must be an  existing  absolute  path, i.e. not
relative to its current location.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following call
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
set-registry "/history" "foo/win32/printer" "foo-bar"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
constructs a registry hierarchy of the form:-
.CS
"history" {
  "foo" {
    "win32" {
      "printer"="foo-bar";
    }
  }
}
.CE
The value of the registry node may be retrieved using:-
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
&reg "/history" "foo/win32/printer"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
which would return the value "\fCfoo-bar\fR".
.SH NOTES
The  \fBget-registry\fR  command  was  removed in January  2005 in  preference
to the  
.Ht &reg 4
function, the existing get command was never used.
