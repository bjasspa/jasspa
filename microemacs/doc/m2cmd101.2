.SH DESCRIPTION
.B print-buffer
and
.B print-region
print the current buffer or region,  respectively, using  high-lighting  where
appropriate. The hilighting assigned to a buffer is defined by the variable
.Ht $buffer-hilight 5
the print scheme is defined with
.Ht print-scheme 2 ,
the
.Ht scheme-editor 3
should be used to create printer schemes.
.PP
The printing  is typically configured using
.Ht print-setup 3 ,
which can be found in the main menu under \fBFile->Printer Setup\fR.
.PP
The numerical  argument  \fIn\fR is generally used for macro  development,  it
changes the default behaviour of these commands as follows:
.IP \fB\-2\fR
Configures  the  printer  and, on win32  platforms,  opens a Windows  printing
dialog box enabling the user to configure  the printer,  font and page layout.
The configuration is stored in the "\fC/print\fR" registry.
.IP \fB\-1\fR
Configures  the  printer, the  configuration  is stored in the  "\fC/print\fR"
registry.
.IP \fB\0\fR
Configures  the  printer  and, on win32  platforms,  opens a Windows  printing
dialog box enabling the user to configure  the printer,  font and page layout.
The required printing is then performed.
.IP \fB\0\fR
Configures  the  printer  and performs the required printing.
.SS "Printing Process"
When either of these commands are executed the macro file  \fCprint.emf\fR  is
executed to configure the printer (in a same vain as  \fCme.emf\fR is executed
to configure  \*(mS for general usage). After the macro file has been executed
the  "\fC/print\fR"   registry  must  contain  the  information  required  for
printing. Following is a list of registry entries and their use:
.IP \fBflags\fR
.IP \fBpaper-x\fR
.IP \fBpaper-y\fR

.SS "Printing Under Microsoft Windows Environments"
Printing under Microsoft Windows Environments  automatically  invokes a dialog
box to assign and configure the printer page  characteristics.  The dialog box
allows  the  printer to be  selected,  enables  line  numbering,  headers  and
footers.
.PP
The dialog  allows the user to select the font size, by defining the number of
characters that appear on a logical page, and the number of logical pages that
appear  on  a  physical   page.   Selecting  the  logical  and  physical  page
characteristics  determine  the size of the font. For dense pages with a small
typeface then a point size of 6 is appropriate. For clarity, a larger typeface
of 10 or 12 points is advised.
.SH NOTES
The last  printer  configuration  selected by the user is held in the registry
file "\fCprint.erf\fR" which is loaded into the \fI/print-history\fR  registry
section. This feature is implemented in the macro file \fCprint.emf\fR.
.SH BUGS
Landscape printing under Microsoft Windows environments is temperamental.
.PP
Font selection under Microsoft Windows  environments does not always determine
the most appropriate font size.
.PP
The printer  interface  does not support  native  postscript  generation.  (In
progress).
