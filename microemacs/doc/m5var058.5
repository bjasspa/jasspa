.TH $file-ignore 5
.XI $file-ignore - "File extensions to ignore"
.SH NAME
$file-ignore \- File extensions to ignore
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB$file-ignore\fR "\fIstring\fR"; Default is ""
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B $file-ignore
specifies a space  separated list of file endings which the file completion is to ignore. This is used by any function
which prompts the user for a file name, such as
.Ht find-file 2 .
A file ending in this case is \s-1NOT\s0 the extension but the last \fIn\fR  characters where \fIn\fR is the number of
characters in the specified ignore file.
.PP
The  variable  can be used to ignore  directories  by making the last  character of the postfix a '\fC/\fR'  directory
character, see examples below. The variable can also affect the directories listed by the
.Ht directory-tree 2
command. 
.SH EXAMPLE
To ignore all files which have the extension "\fCo\fR", using:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
set-variable $file-ignore "o"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
would not only ignore  "\fCfoo.o\fR", but also "\fCfoo.oo\fR",  "\fCfoo.po\fR"
and  "\fCfoo\fR" as well as any file that ends in an "\fCo\fR". What is really
required is
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
set-variable $file-ignore ".o"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
It is useful to ignore the  "\fC./\fR"  and  "\fC../\fR"  directories  so that a
directory  containing  one file  will  auto-complete  to that one  file.  This
is achieved by using:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
set-variable $file-ignore "./"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
To ignore \*(mS backup files ("\fC~\fR"), C object files ("\fC.o\fR"), "\fC./\fR" and "\fC../\fR" directories try
using:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
set-variable $file-ignore "~ .o ./"
.CE 0
.Me $ehf-scheme
.SH NOTES
The file  completion only completes further than the first non-unique point in
the current  list of  possibles if and only if it can ignore all but one file,
so if the current directory contains:
.CS
\&./ ../ foo foo.c foo.c~ foo.o
.CE
using the above ignore list,  completing  with "" has no effect as "\fCfoo\fR"
and  "\fCfoo.c\fR"  cannot  be  ignored;  completing  with  "\fCfoo.\fR"  will
however complete to "\fCfoo.c\fR".
