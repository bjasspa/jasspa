.SH DESCRIPTION
.B forward-delete-char
deletes the next \fIn\fR  characters from the current cursor position. If the cursor is at the end of a line, the next
line is joined onto the end of the current line. If a numeric argument is given the character(s) are added to the kill
buffer, otherwise the kill buffer remains unaltered.
.PP
.B backward-delete-char
deletes the next \fIn\fR characters immediately to the left of the cursor (e.g. more conventionally backspace). If the
cursor is at the  beginning of a line, this joins the current line to the end of the previous  line. If an argument is
given then the character is added to the kill buffer, otherwise the kill buffer remains unaltered.
.PP
Where the numeric argument is \fC0\fR the command has no effect. A negative argument changes the direction.
.SH NOTES
.B forward-delete-char
is also bound to \fB\*(dE\fR and \fB\*s\*(dE\fR.
.PP
.B backward-delete-char
is also bound to \fB\*s\*(bS\fR.
.SH HISTORY
As of December 2004 the mode
.Hr letter 2m 
which  controlled  whether  the  deleted  character  is added to the kill buffer was  removed.  Letter mode used to be
disabled by default, the behavior of the old letter mode, when enabled, may be achieved through the key bindings:-
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
1 global-bind-key backward-delete-char "backspace"
1 global-bind-key forward-delete-char "delete"
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
The use of the numeric argument of 1 in the global binding has the same effect as the existing
.Hr letter 2m 
mode (when enabled).
