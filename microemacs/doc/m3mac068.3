.SH DESCRIPTION
.B c-to-cpp-convert
changes the buffer type from C to C++ and loads the C++ language template
.Ht cpp 9 .
The  command  is only  available  once a 'C' file is loaded as the  command is
defined within the C language template file \fChkc.emf\fR.
.PP
The  command is  normally  used when a new C++ file is being  created,  if the
default  file type is C rather than C++ then the new file is  converted to C++
by changing the magic string from
.C "-*-\ c\ -*-"
to \fC-*-\ c++\ -*-\fR, whenever the file is subsequently  loaded then it will
be presented in the correct mode.
