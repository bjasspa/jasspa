.XI undo - "Retain edit modifications"
.SH NAME
undo \- Retain edit modifications
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "undo Mode"
.sp
\fBU\fR \- mode line letter.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B undo
mode, when enabled, stores a history of all user edits so that the command
.Ht undo 2
may be used to undo the last  \fIn\fR  edits to a buffer.  If this mode is not
enabled the \fBundo\fR command has no effect.
.PP
Obviously memory is required to store this information,  particularly  storing
deleted,  reformed or replaced text, users editing large files or operating in
restricted memory environments may wish to use this mode selectively.
.SH NOTES
The \fBundo\fR  information  is flushed, and is effectively  lost, when a save
operation is performed on the buffer.
