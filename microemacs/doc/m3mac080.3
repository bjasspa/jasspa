.SH DESCRIPTION
.B save-session
writes out \*(mS's current  session information  into the given session file.
.PP
The command
.Ht read-session 3
can set a default session file in which case the session is automatically written out to this file if an argument of
zero is given; the user is not prompted for a file. \*(mS automatically tries to write the default session whenever it
is exited.
.PP
The \fBsession-setp\fR command opens a simple dialog to configure the current session. The saving of the kill chain 
and bookmarks can be extremely useful, but can also greatly increase the size of a session file and the time 
taken to read and write it.
.SH NOTES
The session information is saved in a ascii format file (see
.Ht esf 8 ).
Reference should be made to the notes included in
.Ht esf 8
as to how the session file may be edited and effected in the same \*(mS session.
