.TH %http-cookies 5
.XI %http-cookies - "Set HTTP request cookies"
.SH NAME
%http-cookies \- Set HTTP request cookies
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB%http-cookies\fR "\fIcookie=value; ...\fR"; Default is undefined
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the \fB%http-cookies\fR variable is set all HTTP file loading requests,
using commands like
.Ht find-file 2 ,
are sent with a \fBCookie:\fR request header (if not an empty string) and all response \fBSet-Cookie:\fR header values
will be merged into the current value, i.e. if the named cookie already exists in the \fB%http-cookies\fR variable its
value will be updated.
.PP
If the variable is not defined then no \fBCookie:\fR request header is sent and all response \fBSet-Cookie:\fR headers
are ignored.
.SH NOTES
The variable should take the form of "<name1>=<value1>; <name2>=<value2>; ...; <name#>=<value#>" with no trailing ';',
names and values should be URL encoded.
.PP
As with variables like
@wl 4 ,
the returned value can be longer than the maximum length of a user defined  variable so care is needed if manipulating
its value using macro code.
.PP
\*(mS cookie support is minimal, it does not support  domains,  expires, paths etc. it is up to the user or supporting
macros to implement any additional features required.
