.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfind-bfile\fR  and  \fBfind-rfile\fR  both load a file as binary data, providing binary editing  capabilities.  The
commands operate as command
.Ht find-file 2
except that they load the given  file with
.Ht binary 2m
or
.Ht rbin 2m
mode set.
.PP
\fBfind-bfile\fR, which uses \s-1binary\s0 mode, loads any file and converts every 16 bytes into a line of text giving
the hex address of the current position in the file, the bytes as hexadecimal numbers and all printable  characters at
the end of the line (all non-printable  characters are displayed as a '\fC.\fR'). However, This format makes it memory
hungry in that every 16 bytes of the file requires a 78 character line (approximately 5 times more memory!).
.PP
\fBfind-rfile\fR,  which  uses  \s-1rbin\s0  mode,  loads any file and  converts  every 256 bytes  into a line of text
containing only 2 hexadecimal numbers per byte leading to a line length of 512 characters. This format greatly reduces
the memory required (approximately 2 times more memory) making it ideal for large binary file editing.
.PP
The extension of a file loaded using binary or rbin mode is ignored with respect to file hooks (See
.Ht add-file-hook 2 ).
Instead the \fBfhook-binary\fR or \fBfhook-rbin\fR command is always executed if it exists.
.PP
Each line of text may be edited,  providing that the basic format of every line remains the same, the altered file may
be written out, providing full binary editing capabilities.
.SH EXAMPLE
Given a single line \s-1MSDOS\s0 file:-
.CS
Live long and prosper.
.CE
When loaded in using \fBfind-bfile\fR will produce the following 2 line buffer:-
.CS
00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 6C 6F 6E 67 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live long and pr
00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A                       |  osper....
.CE
Note  the  "\fC0D  0A  1A\fR"  at  the  end,  this  is  due to  \s-1MSDOS\s0's
"\fC\\n\\r\fR"   carriage  returns  and  \fC^Z\fR  file   termination,   these
characters  are  unprintable and are shown as '\fC.\fR' at the end of the line.
The basic form of a binary file is:-
.CS
AAAAAAAA: XX XX XX XX ....  |
.CE
When saving a binary file, only the text  between the  '\fC:\fR' and '\fC|\fR'
is considered and it may contain any number of hexadecimal  numbers. The given
file could be made \s-1UNIX\s0 compatible by editing the buffer to:-
.CS
00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 6C 6F 6E 67 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live long and pr
00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D                       |  osper....
.CE
If the word  "\fBlong\fR"  is required to be removed, the following  would not
work:-
.CS
00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 6C 6F 6E 67 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live and pr
00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A                       |  osper....
.CE
The ASCII end letters are ignored,  instead the  following  operation  must be
performed which removes the characters from the binary representation:-
.CS
00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 61 6E 64 20 70 72  |  Live long and pr
00000010: 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A                       |  osper....
.CE
One could be nasty by doing the following:-
.CS
00000000: 4C 69 76 65 20 73 68 6F 72 74 20 61 6E 64 20 |
00000010: 64 6F 6E 27 74 20 70 72 6F 73 70 65 72 2E 0D 0A 1A           |
.CE
("Live  short  and  don't  prosper").  If this  file  was  then  loaded  using
\fBfind-rfile\fR, the following single line buffer would be created:-
.CS
4C6976652073686F727420616E6420646F6E27742070726F737065722E0D0A1A
