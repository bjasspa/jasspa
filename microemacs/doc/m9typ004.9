.SH DESCRIPTION
The  \fBlatex\fR  file  type  template  handles  the  hilighting  of  the  TeX
files. The hilighting is minimal, hilighting the key words and comments.
.IP "\fBGeneral Editing\fR"
On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into the file.
.Ht time 2m
is by default enabled, allowing the modification time-stamp to be maintained in
the header.
.IP \fBHilighting\fR
The  hilighting  emphasizes the Tex embedded  command  strings and comments. No
special recognition of the command strings is performed.
.IP "\fBOutline Hilighting\fR"
The LaTeX content may be viewed with synthetic  hilighting  such that headers,
text  in  bold  and  italic  are   displayed,   removing  the  LaTeX   control
sequences.
.IP "\fBShort Cuts\fR"
The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-
.IP
\fB\*cc \*cc\fR \- Comment out the current line.
.br
\fB\*cc \*cd\fR \- Uncomment the current line.
.sp 1
The command  \fBlatex-compile\fR  is available within the buffer which invokes
an external process to build the text.
