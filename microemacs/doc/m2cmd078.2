.SH DESCRIPTION
.B isearch-forward
provides  an  interactive  search in the forward  direction.  This  command is
similar to
.Ht search-forward 2 ,
but it processes the search as each character of the input string is typed in.
This allows the user to only use as many key-strokes as are needed to uniquely
specify  the string  being  searched.  The string  argument  \fIarg\fR  is not
supplied when invoked interactively.
.PP
The follow keys can be used at the start of an incremental search only:
.IP
\fC\*cs\fR \- Search for last string.
.br
\fC\*cm\fR \- Perform a search-forward instead.
.br
\fC\*ep\fR,
.br
\fC\*en\fR \- Scroll through history list etc (See
.Ht ml-bind-key 2 ).
.LP
Several control characters are active while isearching:
.IP "\fB\*cs\fR or \fB\*(cX\fR"
Skip to the next occurrence of the current string
.IP \fB\*cr\fR
Skip to the last occurrence of the current string
.IP \fB\*ch\fR
Back up to the last match (possibly deleting the last character on the search string)
.IP \fB\*cw\fR
Insert the next word into the search string.
.IP \fB\*cg\fR
Abort the search, return to start.
.IP "\fB\*e\fR or \fB\*cm\fR"
End the search, stay here
.LP
.B isearch-backward
is the same as \fBisearch-forward\fR, but it searches in the reverse direction.
.PP
For both  commands  when the end of the buffer is  reached, an alarm is raised
(bell  etc.) a  further  search  request  (\fC\*cs\fR)  causes  the  search to
commence  from the start of the  buffer.
.PP
The numeric argument \fIn\fR controls the behavior of  \fBisearch-*\fR  at the
end of the buffer. When  specified  as \fC0\fR then the search  exits when the
start/end of the buffer is reached and the search is  exhausted.  When omitted
(or specified as \fC1\fR) then the search  recommences  again at the start/end
of the buffer, this is the default behavior.
.PP
When  \fBisearch-*\fR  is  invoked  from a  macro  then  the  string  argument
\fIarg\fR specifies the search string. \fBisearch\fR is primarily designed for
for  interactive  use and is not  typically  used  from  within a macro.  When
embedded in a macro then it is typically  invoked with the \fC0\fR argument so
that the calling macro may handle the start/end of buffer condition. The macro
.Ht page-file 3 
uses  \fBisearch-*\fR and performs exactly this operation, for a comprehensive
example refer to macro file \fCpagefile.emf\fR.
.SH NOTES
The
.Ht ml-bind-key 2
bindings are used.
.PP
The incremental search supports buffer modes
.Ht exact 2m
and
.Ht magic 2m .
.SH HISTORY
The numeric argument to  \fBisearch-*\fR  was first introduced into MicroEmacs
\'04.
.SH BUGS
Due to the dynamic nature of active
.Ht ipipe-shell-command 2
buffers  the search  history  cannot be stored in the same way (list of fixed
locations).  As a result  the search  history is stored as a list of  searches
which are not guaranteed to be consistent.
