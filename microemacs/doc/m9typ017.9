.SH "MAGIC STRINGS"
.TP 
\fB#![ \\t]*/.*sh\fR
.\"
\*(mE recognizes the magic string on the first line of the file used to locate
the  executable.  The  shell  files  may  be  extension  less  and  are  still
recognized.  Note that this is the typical  method of identifying  shell files
and will recognize other files not mentioned above i.e. \fBbash\fR shells.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBshell\fR  file type template  provides  simple  hilighting of the shell
files. It offers as well folding and support for displaying and outline of the
functions of the shell script for easy navigation using the 
.Ht item-list 3
command and expanding abbreviations either via short strings using the
.Ht expand-abbrev-handle 3
command and visual inserting abbreviations using the
.Ht abbrev-list 3
macro. 
.IP "\fBFolding and Information Hiding\fR"
Generic  folding is enabled  within the Shell files. The folds occur about
the function keyword and closing braces \fBfunction...{\fR...\fB}\fR located
on the left-hand margin. The following command are supported to show and hide
the function bodies.
.Ht collapse-all 3
(un)folds all regions in the file,
.Ht collapse-current 3
(un)folds the current region.
.IP "\fBAbbreviations\fR"
The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for shell  editing
which can be used by writing  short  abbreviations  like  "\fBfor\fR"  and the
pressing the key-binding for the 
.Ht expand-abbrev-handle 3
command.  The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI
version of \*(mE using the 
.Ht abbrev-list 3
command.
.SH NOTES
.PP  The  file  hook  is  implemented  in  the  \fChkshell.emf\fR   file,  the
abbreviations are placed within the \fCshell.arg\fR file, the template for the
initialization of the new file is defined in the \fCshell.etf\fR file.
.SH BUGS
None reported.
.PP
There is a heavy bias towards Bourne, Korn and Zsh shells. The author is not a
csh shell user so has probably missed a lot of csh features.
