.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets the buffer create, delete, begin and end hook command which are executed:
.IP \fBbuffer-fhook\fR
When the buffer is created.
.IP \fBbuffer-dhook\fR
When the buffer is deleted.
.IP \fBbuffer-bhook\fR
When the buffer becomes the current buffer.
.IP \fBbuffer-ehook\fR
When the buffer is swapped out from being the current buffer.
.LP
The variable \fB$buffer-fhook\fR is largely redundant as the file hook is executed only once and before it can be
set. Its main use is within macros which wish to ascertain what type of buffer it is executing on, i.e. if a command
was to be executed only on c file then the follow ensures that this is the case:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
!if &not &seq $buffer-fhook "fhook-cmode"
    !abort
!endif
.CE
.Me $ehf-scheme
Where the command \fIfhook-cmode\fR is the c file hook.
.PP
\fBdhooks\fR are executed when a buffer is deleted, but before the contents of the buffer are lost. Note that dhooks
will not be called if the buffer never becomes active, or if \*(mS quits due to the receipt of a panic signal.
.PP
\fBbhooks\fR and \fBehooks\fR are usually used to set and restore global variables which require different setting in
the current buffer.
.PP
These variables are set by the system when the buffer first becomes active, the order, or priority, of the different
file hooks is determined by the command
.Ht add-file-hook 2 .
