This page describes introductory notes for the installation and setup of \*(mE.
.SS "Quick Install"
The quickest way to install MicroEmacs for testing without reading the rest of
this document is to:-
.BS
Create a new directory i.e. \fCjasspa\fR.
.BU
Unpack the macros archive into this directory.
.BU
Unpack the executable into this directory.
.BU
Run \fCme\fR from this directory.
.BE
On  starting,  you  will be  prompted  for a  default  directory,  accept  the
defaults. Use the mouse and configure the user from the menu bar:-
.CS
Tools -> User Setup
.CE
This  allows the user and screen  settings  to be  altered. On  becoming  more
accustomed to the editor then a fuller installation may be performed.

.B NOTE:
The binary  versions of the executables  held on the site include the platform
name as part of the  executable  name i.e.  \fBme\fR  for  \fCDOS\fR is called
\fBmedos.exe\fR.  On  installing  the  binaries  onto the target  machine, you
should  rename  the  executable  to  \fBme\fR  or  \fBme.exe\fR,  whatever  is
appropriate.  The  ONLY  exception  to  this  rule  is the  Microsoft  Windows
executable where \fBmewin32.exe\fR should be renamed to \fBme32.exe\fR.
Our reason for this naming is to allow the  executables  to be  unpacked in the
same directory and not be confused with each other.
.SS "Installation Directories"
The suggested installation structure for all platforms is defined as:-
.CS

          / | \\
         /  |  \\
        /   |   \\
 spelling macros company
.CE
This  directory   structure  is  suggested  to  facilitate   upgrades  in  the
future  and  to  keep  user  data  separate  from  the  system  macros.  \*(mS
understands this directory structure.
.PP
The directory structures are defined as:
.IP "\fBmacros\fR"
The standard macro distribution, as supplied by JASSPA.
.IP "\fBspelling\fR"
Spelling dictionaries.
.IP "\fBcompany\fR"
Company  wide local  definitions  for the local  site. This  directory  may be
omitted if not applicable.  Header templates  (\fC.etf\fR are typically copied
from the \fCmacro\fR directory to the \fCcompany\fR directory and modified for
the local site.
.LP
The  search  order is  defined  as  \fCroot\fR,  \fCcompany\fR,  \fCmacros\fR,
\fCspelling\fR.
.SS "UNIX Installation (System Wide)"
A system wide  installation  on  \s-1UNIX\s0  for  multiple  users  adheres to
conventional package installation methods.

.BS
Create the directory \fC/usr/local/jasspa\fR.
.BU
Unpack  and   install   the   \fCjasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz\fR   into  this
directory.
.BU
If spelling  dictionaries  are required then place them in the  \fIspelling\fR
sub-directory  created when  \fImetree\fR was unpacked. Unpack and install the
\fCspelling\fR into this directory.
.BU
If the standard icons are required for Gnome, KDE or some other window manager
then  create the  sub-directory  \fC/usr/local/jasspa/icons\fR  and unpack and
install the icons into the new directory.
.BU
Unpack (or build) the executable and place in "\fC/usr/local/bin\fR"
.BE
The  executable  may now be run by all users. If the  macros  are  placed in a
non-standard directory location then the environment variable
.Ht MEINSTALLPATH 5
to define the root jasspa tree.
.PP
For
.Hr csh 1
users  execute a "\fCrehash\fR"  command and then
.Ht me 1
can be executed from the command line.
.PP
By default a X-Windows terminal is displayed, ensure that \fC$DISPLAY\fR and \fC$TERM\fR are correctly  configured. To
execute a terminal  emulation then execute  \fBme\fR with the \fC\-n\fR option i.e. "\fCme\ \-n\fR". Note that this is
not required if you are using a \fCvt100\fR emulation.
.PP
When \*(mS is executed the local  directory  \fC~/.config/jasspa\fR  is created for the user  settings.  The user home
directory may be changed by setting the environment variable
.Ht $MEPATH 5 .
.SS "UNIX Installation (Single User)"
Where the user is not  permitted  to  install  3rd party  applications  in the  system  directories  then \*(mS may be
installed locally as follows:-
.BS
Create the directory \fC~/.config/jasspa\fR.
.BU
Unpack and install the \fCjasspa-metree-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz\fR into this directory.
.BU
If spelling  dictionaries are required then place them in the \fIspelling\fR  sub-directory  created when \fImetree\fR
was unpacked. Unpack and install the \fCspelling\fR into this directory.
.BU
If the  standard  icons are  required  for Gnome, KDE or some  other  window  manager  then  create the  sub-directory
\fC~/.config/jasspa/icons\fR and unpack and install the icons into the new directory.
.BU
The user files will be placed in the  \fC~/.config/jasspa\fR  directory  by default. To keep the user macros  separate
then the directory \fC~/.config/jasspa/$LOGNAME\fR may be created and will identified as the users home directory.
.BU
Unpack (or build) the executable and place in "\fC~/bin\fR"
.BE
\*(mS may be executed after it has been re-hashed (depending on the shell).
.SS "DOS Installation"
\s-1MS-DOS\s0  has  no  concept  of a  standard  installation  directory.  The
location  of the \*(mS  macros  is  generally  determined  from the  directory
location of the executable.

Under  \fBWin32s\fR  a helper  \s-1DLL\s0  \fBmethnk16.dll\fR  is  required to
perform the
.Ht pipe-shell-command 2
in   a   synchronous    manner.   This   should   be   installed    into   the
\fCC:\\WINDOWS\\SHELL\fR  directory. This (rather inelegantly) gets around the
problems of spawning a process under \fBwin32s\fR due to a number of Microsoft
bugs in the operating  system. Note: that on a spawn  operation a \fCMS-DOS\fR
window is  visible,  this is due to the  nature of the  command  shell on this
platform which has a tendency to prompt the user at every opportunity, hence a
certain amount of interaction (which is out of our control) is necessary.

.BE
.B "Open Actions"
Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT provide short cut actions, assigning an open action
to a file. The short  cuts may be  installed  from the  \fBInstall  Shield\fR
installation,  but may  alternatively  be  explicitly  defined by editing  the
registry file with
.Hr regedit 1 .
.PP
A file open  action in the  registry is bound to the file file  extension,  to
bind a file  extension  \fI.foo\fR to the editor then the  following  registry
entries should be defined:-
.CS
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.foo]
"MicroEmacs_foo"
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\MicroEmacs_foo\\DefaultIcon]
"C:\\Program File\\JASSPA\\MicroEmacs\\meicons,23"
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\MicroEmacs_foo\\Shell\\open]
"&Open"
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\MicroEmacs_foo\\Shell\\open\\command]
"C:\\Program File\\JASSPA\\MicroEmacs\\me32.exe -o "%1""
.CE
In the previous example the \fIDefaultIcon\fR entry is the icon assigned to the
file.  This may be an icon  taken  from  \fCmeicons.exe\fR  (in this case icon
number 23), or may be some other icon. The open action in the example uses the
\fB-o\fR  option  of the  \fIclient-server\fR,  which  loads the file into the
current \*(mE session, alternatively the \fB-c\fR option may be used to retain
the previous context, or no option if a new session with no other files loaded
is started.
.PP
A generic open for \s-1ALL\s0  files may be defined using a wild-card, this may
be used to place a \fIMicroEmacs\fR  edit entry in the right-click pop-up menu,
as follows:-
.CS
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\*\\shell]
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\*\\shell\\MicroEmacs]
"&MicroEmacs"
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\*\\shell\\MicroEmacs\\command]
"C:\\Program File\\JASSPA\\MicroEmacs\\me32.exe -o "%1""
.CE 0
.SH "ORGANIZING A LOCAL USER PROFILE"
\*(mS uses  local user  configuration  profiles  to store user  specific
information. The user  information may be stored in the MicroEmacs  directory,
or more  typically in a users  private  directory.  On login  systems then the
user name and user private directory location is automatically determined from
the system.
.PP
The user name identified by \*(mS is
.Ht $user-name 5
this value may be set or re-defined using the environment variable
.Ht $MENAME 5 .
On  \s-1MS-DOS\s0  and early windows systems where there is no user login then
then
.Ht $MENAME 5
may be defined in the environment.
.PP
The  location  of  the  user  information   depends  upon  your  platform  and
installation   configuration. The private directory identified by \*(mS is
.Ht $user-path 5
this location may be changed by defining the environment variable
.Ht $MEUSERPATH 5 .
.SS "User Profile Files"
Files contained in the user profiles typically include:-
.PP
\fI<name>\fR\fC.emf\fR \- The users start up profile - \|\fI<user>\fR\|.emf.
.br
\fI<name>\fR\fC.edf\fR \- The users spelling dictionary.
.br
\fI<name>\fR\fC.erf\fR \- The users registry configuration file.
.PP
These files are automatically set up by \*(mS.
These  files are  established  from the menu  "\fBTools\fR -> \fBUser  Setup\fR".  The
"\fBSetup  Path\fR"  item  defines  the  location  of the  files,  but must be
\s-1MANUALLY\s0 included in the \fC$MEPATH\fR environment.
.SS "Company Profiles"
Company  profiles  include standard files and extensions to the standard files
which may be related to a company, this is typically \fI<company>\fR.emf where
\fI<company>\fR is the name of the company.
