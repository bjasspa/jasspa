.SH NAME
reyank \- Restore next yank buffer
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBreyank\fR \*(C0

.SH DESCRIPTION
Every  region  killed  goes  onto a stack,  with the most  recent  at the top.
Immediately after yanking text out into the current buffer using
.Ht yank 2 ,
the user may \fBreyank\fR which deletes the region just yanked and replaces it
with \fIn\fR  insertions of the next region on the kill stack. Another call to
reyank deletes that region and replaces it with the next in the stack etc.
.PP
The  default  behavior of  \fBreyank\fR  is to wrap around the kill chain in a
loop (i.e.  returns to the start of the list when the end of the kill chain is
reached). If a negative argument \fIn\fR is specified then \fBreyank\fR  fails
when the end of the kill  chain is reached  rather  than  looping  back to the
start of the list.
.PP
The last 15 kills are stored.
