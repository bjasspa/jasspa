cycles through all visible buffers (buffers without mode
.Ht hide 2m

file from where it was read. For each buffer that has been  modified  the user
is prompted to save the buffer, the following responses can be given:
.IP \fBy\fR
Saves the buffer and moves to the next modified buffer.
.IP \fBn\fR
Does not save the buffer and moves to the next modified buffer.
\fBa\fR
Saves all remaining modified buffers including the current one without further prompting.
\fBo\fR
Skips all remaining buffers including the current one.
\fBg\fR
Display the buffer and aborts the command.
.PP
The  argument  \fIn\fR  can  be  used  to  change  the  default  behavior  of
save-some-buffers described above, \fIn\fR is a bit based flag where:-
.IP \fB0x01\fR
Enables the user prompt before the buffer is saved  (default). If this flag is
not supplied then all modified visible buffers will be written.
