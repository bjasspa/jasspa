.TH $frame-title 5
.XI $frame-title - "Set frame title prefix"
.SH NAME
$frame-title \- Set frame title prefix
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB$frame-title\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
On  windowing  systems, such as UNIX XTerm and Windows, the frame title is composed of the \fB$frame-title\fR followed
by the  current buffer. Setting the variable can be  particularly  useful when running \*(mS multiple times as an easy
way to distinguish between each instance.
.PP
The
.Ht read-session 3
command  sets this  variable  to  "\fC\*(mS:  <session-name>\fP"  so that if  multiple  instance of \*(mS are run with
different sessions each can be easily identified.
.SH "NOTES"
Unlike other frame variables, such as
.Ht $frame-id 5 ,
there is only one \fB$frame-title\fR value, changing its value will effect the titles of all external frames.
