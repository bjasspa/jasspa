.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdirectory-tree\fR  creates or  manipulates  a view of the file systems  directory  structure.  The command is quite
complex to use directly so is largely used by macros such as
.Ht file-browser 3 .
.PP
The  argument  \fIn\fR is a bit based flag which is used to control  the  command,  where the bits have the  following
meaning:-
.IP \fB0x01\fR
If set, the focal directory of the command is set by the given  "\fIdirectory\fR"  argument. Otherwise the argument is
not required and the command must be executed within the  "\fI*directory*\fR"  buffer; the current line sets the focal
directory.
.IP \fB0x02\fR
Specifies that the current line in resultant  "\fI*directory*\fR" window should be set to the focal directory. If this
bit is not set then the current line will be the last  selected  directory,  or if none have been  selected, the first
line in the buffer.
.IP \fB0x04\fR
Specifies that any evaluations  required during the commands  operation should be performed. Without this flag an open
operation on a directory  which has not  previously  been  evaluated will not be perform an evaluation and the results
will likely be incomplete.
.IP \fB0x08\fR
Specifies that the current focal directory should be opened. This means that sub-directories  within the current focal
directory will also be drawn in the directory tree.
.IP \fB0x10\fR
Specifies that the current focal directory should be closed. This means that sub-directories  within the current focal
directory will not be drawn in the directory tree.
.IP \fB0x20\fR
Specifies that the current focal directory's open state should be toggled. This means that if the  sub-directories are
currently hidden they will now be drawn and vice-versa.
.IP \fB0x40\fR
When specified any directory opened will be re-evaluated, ensuring the accuracy of the information.
.IP \fB0x80\fR
Enables a  recursive  behavior,  for  example  if this flag was  specified  with the open then not only will the focal
directory  be opened,  but all of it's  children,  and their  children  etc. Note that if the  Evaluation  flag is not
specified then only the already evaluated directories can be opened.
.IP "\fB0x100\fR & \fB0x200\fR"
If both bits  \fB0x100\fR  and \fB0x200\fR are set then the current filter mode is toggled; if only bit \fB0x100\fR is
set then the filter mode is disabled (not  filtered), if only bit  \fB0x200\fR is set then the filter mode is enabled,
and if neither is set then the filter mode is left unchanged.
.PP
directory-tree  creates a new buffer  "\fI*directory*\fR" and draws the known directory tree. Every drawn directory is
preceded by a character flag giving the user an indication of the directory state, where:
.IP \fB?\fR
Directory has not been evaluated.
.IP \fB-\fR
Directory has been evaluated and is visible.
.IP \fB+\fR
Directory has been evaluated but is currently hidden.
.PP
Directories which have been evaluated and found to have no children use the '-'
.Ht $box-chars 5
instead of a '-' character.
.PP
On UNIX platforms, if a directory is a symbolic link to another  directory, the link name is given after the directory
name.
.PP
If the filter mode is enabled, default, then only directories which do not match a
.Ht file-ignore 5
postfix are listed. All non-hidden directories are listed when the filter mode is disabled.
.SH EXAMPLE
The best example of the use of directory-tree is
.Ht file-browser 3
which can be found in hkdirlst.emf.
