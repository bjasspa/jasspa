.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBchange-window-depth\fR  changes  the depth of the  current  window,  if the
numeric  argument \fIn\fR is given then the window depth is changed by \fIn\fR
lines.  If  \fIn\fR  is not  specified  the  user  is  prompted  for  the  new
\fIdepth\fR  and the window  depth will be changed to this value. The  command
aborts if the requested  size cannot be achieved (the window becomes too small
or a neighbouring one does).
.SH NOTES
Commands   \fBgrow-window-vertically\fR,   \fBshrink-window-vertically\fR  and
\fBresize-window-vertically\fR      were      replaced      by     the     new
\fBchange-window-depth\fR   command  in  April  2002.   Following   are  macro
implementations of the old commands:
