.SH DESCRIPTION
Flow can be controlled  within a \*(mE macro using the \fB!goto\fR  directive.
It takes as an  argument  a  \fIlabel\fR.  A  \fIlabel\fR  consists  of a line
starting  with an  asterisk  (\fB*\fR)  and then an  alphanumeric  label. Only
labels in the currently  executing macro can be jumped to, trying to jump to a
non-existing  label  terminates  execution  of a  macro.  \fIlabels\fR  may be
located at any  position  within the macro  (forwards  or  backwards  from the
\fB!goto\fR).
.PP
A  conditional  jump may be  implemented  with a  \fB!tgoto\fR,  this takes an
additional argument  \fIcondition\fR,  which may be a literal numeric value, a
variable or an evaluated expression (see
.Hl "Variable  Functions"  Functions - ).
If the \fIcondition\fR  evaluates to \s-1TRUE\s0 (or non-zero) then the branch
is taken and control continues from the \fIlabel\fR.
.PP
\fB!tgoto\fR is an ideal replacement for
.Ht !while 4
and
.Ht !repeat 4
where nested loops are required.
.SH EXAMPLE
For example, create a block of DATA statements for a BASIC program:
.Me $emf-scheme
.CS
        insert-string "1000 DATA "
        set-variable %linenum 1000
*nxtin
        screen-update           ;make sure we see the changes
        set-variable %data @ml"Next number: "
        !if &equal %data 0
            !goto finish
        !endif
        !if &greater $curcol 60
            2 backward-delete-char
            newline
            set-variable %linenum &add %linenum 10
            insert-string &cat %linenum " DATA "
        !endif
        insert-string &cat %data ", "
        !goto nxtin
*finish
        2 backward-delete-char
        newline

Not that any of us are writing basic programs these days !!
.SH NOTES
\fB!goto\fR and \fB!tgoto\fR are expensive  operations because a symbolic name
lookup is performed in the macro file. For time critical macros then the
.Ht !jump 4
and
.Ht !tjump 4
directives  should be used as these do not perform a symbolic name search. The
\fIjump\fR  equivalents are source sensitive since a line displacement  rather
than a \fIlabel\fR is used - this makes them a little dangerous to use.
