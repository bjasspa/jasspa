.SH DESCRIPTION
.B list-buffers
splits the current  window and in one half brings up a list of all the buffers  currently  existing in the editor. The
active  modes, change flag, and active flag for each buffer is displayed.  (The change flag is a \fB*\fR  character if
the buffer has been  changed and not written out. The active flag is not an \fB@\fR if the file had been  specified on
the command line, but has not been read in yet since nothing has switched to that buffer.)
.PP
The numerical argument \fIn\fR is a bitwise flag which determines the information that is displayed by the command, it
is interpreted follows:-
.IP \fB0x01\fR
The default, when the bit is set displays visible buffers only. When clear displays both visible and
.Hl hidden hide 2m
buffers.
.IP \fB0x02\fR
When set shows buffer size information, including file size, memory size and undo size in bytes. 
.PP
The buffer list has some  special  command keys  associated  with it which allow the state of the buffers to be edited
from the  buffer  list, the  editing  allows  buffers  to be killed  and saved to disk. The key codes are  defined  as
follows:-
.IP "\fBreturn\fR or \fB1\fR - Switch to buffer"
Switch to buffer and make it the only buffer.
.IP "\fBspace\fR or \fB2\fR - Move to buffer"
Switch the buffer list window to that buffer.
.IP "\fBD\fR - toggle delete buffer"
Flag buffer for  deletion. A buffer  scheduled  for deletion is marked with a \'\fBD\fR' in first  column. This is not
performed immediately, for the delete to be enacted the '\fBX\fR', execute command, must be given. The flag may be
removed with another '\fBD\fR' or the '\fBU\fR' command.
.IP "\fBE\fR - toggle buffer edit mode"
Toggle the buffer's
.Ht edit 2m
mode, this command is executed immediately.
.IP "\fBS\fR - toggle save buffer"
Flag buffer for saving. A buffer  scheduled  from saving is marked with a \'\fBS\fR' in the second column. This is not
performed immediately, for the buffer to be actually saved the \fBX\fR, execute command, must also be given. Note that
a buffer may be marked for saving and deletion, the save operation is performed before the delete.
.IP "\fBU\fR - unmark buffer"
Unmark the '\fBD\fR' and '\fBS\fR' flags on current line.
.IP "\fBV\fR - toggle buffer view mode"
Toggle the buffer's
.Ht view 2m
mode, this command is executed immediately.
.IP "\fBX\fR - execute"
Execute all the '\fBD\fR' and '\fBS\fR' flags currently set. The \fBS\fRave is
enacted first.
.LP
For all but '\fBX\fR', the buffer  selected is the buffer noted on the current
cursor line. These keys are not remappable.
.SH "NOTES"
The '\fBD\fR' and '\fBS\fR' flags are stored in the \fB:buffer-info\fR buffer variable.
