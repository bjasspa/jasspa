.TH $buffer-hilight 5
.XI $buffer-hilight - "Define current buffer hilighting scheme"
.SH NAME
$buffer-hilight \- Define current buffer hilighting scheme.
.Me $a
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB$buffer-hilight\fR \fIhilightNum\fR; Default is \fC0\fR
.sp
0 <= \fIhilightNum\fR <= 255
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B $buffer-hilight
Sets the current buffer's hi-lighting scheme (see
.Ht hilight 2
for a full  description  of  hi-lighting).  The  default  setting  is 0  which
specifies no hi-lighting,  when set to a non-zero, the hi-light scheme of that
number \s-1MUST\s0 already be defined.
.PP
Terminals that cannot display color directly may still be able to take benefit
from hi-lighting. A terminal that has fonts can use them in the same way using
the
.Ht add-color-scheme 2
command. The hi-light scheme is also  used in printing (see
.Ht print-buffer 2 ).
If, however, your terminal  cannot display color in any way, it is recommended
that hi-lighting is disabled (except when printing) as it does take CPU time.
