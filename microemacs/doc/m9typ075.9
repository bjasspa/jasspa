.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP "\fBGeneral Editing\fR"
On creating a new file, a new header is automatically included into the file.
.Ht time 2m
is by default enabled, allowing the modification time-stamp to be maintained in
the header.
.IP "\fBHilighting\fR"
The  hilighting  features allow  commands,  functions, traits, classes, variables,  logical, comments,   
strings  and  characters  of  the  language  to  be
differentiated and rendered in different colors.
.IP "\fBAuto Layout\fR"
The command
.Ht indent 2
performs automatic layout of the text.
.IP
Comments  may be formatted  using  \fC\*eo\fR,  which  reformats  the  comments
according  to  the  current  fill  paragraph.  If  a  comment  commences  with
\fC/***...\fR then the comment is automatically formatted to a box.
.IP "\fBFolding and Information Hiding\fR"
Generic  folding  is  enabled  within  the Groovy file. The folds  occur  about
lines with leading lowercase characters and an open curly brace at the end of a line and are continued
until the next line with an closing curly brace.
.Ht collapse-all 3
(un)folds all regions in the file,
.Ht collapse-current 3
(un)folds the current region.
.IP "\fBNavigation via Item List\fR"
The Groovy mode offers beside folding as well support for displaying an outline of the
functions, objects, classes and traits. These can be explored with easy navigation using the 
.Ht item-list 3
.IP "\fBAbbreviations\fR"
The  installation  comes with a default  abbreviation  file for Groovy file  editing
which  can  be  used  by  writing  short   abbreviations   like   "\fBfo\fR" (for),
"\fBif\fR", "\fBei\fR" (else if) or "\fBcl\fR" (class) - and then pressing the key-binding for the 
.Ht expand-abbrev-handle 3
command.  The  list  of  abbreviations  can be used  interactively  in the GUI
version of \*(mS using the 
.Ht abbrev-list 3
command.
.IP "\fBWorking Environment\fR"
.Ht compile 3
may be invoked to rebuild the source, the user is prompted to save any files.
.IP "\fBShort Cuts\fR"
The short cut keys used within the buffer are:-
.IP
\fB\*cc \*cc\fR \- Comment out the current line.
.br
\fB\*cc \*cd\fR \- Uncomment the current line.
