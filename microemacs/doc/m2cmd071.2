.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shell
creates a new command processor or shell. Upon exiting the shell, \*(mS redraws its screen and continues editing. The
exceptions to this are as follows:
.IP "\fBX-Windows\fR"
A new \fBxterm\fR is spawned off and editing control is returned to \*(mS once the \fBxterm\fR has initialized.
.IP "\fBMicrosoft Windows\fR"
A new \s-1MS-DOS\s0 shell is created and control is returned to \*(mS once the \s-1DOS\s0 console window has
initialized. The shell created is determined by the \s-1MS-DOS\s0 environment variable \fCCOMSPEC\fR, this may be a
replacement shell e.g. \fC4DOS\fR.
