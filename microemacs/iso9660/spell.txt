Spelling Dictionaries
---------------------

JASSPA's  MicroEmacs  supports  an  automatic  spell  mode,  this
performs  background  spell  checking  and  highlights  erroneous
words. This mode may be enabled by:-

      Help -> User Setup -> Startup -> Auto Spell

Multiple  dictionaries may be supported on the same platform. The
active dictionary may be changed from the dialog of spell buffer.

Files  supplied in the UNIX tar.gz  format may be  downloaded  to
Microsoft  Windows/DOS  environments,  use Winzip or native  UNIX
tools to unpack the files. The spelling  dictionaries may be used
on all supported platforms.

Spelling   dictionaries   are  optional  on  all  platforms.  You
optionally require one or more of these components for a spelling
capability.  Multiple  languages  may be  installed  on a  single
platform.  Select the most suitable down load format, the content
is the same for both .zip and .tar.gz files.
