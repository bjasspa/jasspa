    [040210] BS/0401-4 - Minor - Not this release.

        There are  differences  between  the output  buffer used when  running
        'cvs'  and  using  the  'cvs-*'   commands,  e.g.   *cvs-console*   or
        *cvs-commit* buffer. Should these differences be engineered out? 

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/23 Code and macro change.

    [040216] JG/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        Cygwin shell under  windows does not echo the command line. The cygwin
        behavior  has changed and BASH no longer echos the command  line. This
        means  that  ME must  supply  its own  command  line  and  completion.
        Completion is simplified if the $TERM=EMACS and $EMACS="*term*" as the
        bash  shell  will echo the  current  directory  before the prompt on a
        separate line commencing ^Z to allow the caller to complete.

        Fixed JG/0401-5 04/02/26 Code and macro change.

    [040220] SP/0401-4 - Minor - TBD

        Add new buffer tab list toolbar tool for rapid access to buffers via a
        top or bottom toolbar.

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/23 Code and macro change.
    
    [040220] SP/0401-4 - Minor - TBD

        Add <> buttons to toolbar mode lines to scroll left and right

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/23 Code and macro change.

    [040220] SP/0401-4 - Minor - TBD

        Add new 'narrow out unhilighted lines feature

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/24 Code and macro change.
    
    [040220] BS/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5
    
        Found the mouse  position not set correctly for the mouse wheel events
        as position is absolute.
        
        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/20: Source & macro change.
        
        Fixed the bug by ignoring the position  (will use last  position)  but
        binding this to the base scroll-up  command will now break the toolbar
        as it leaves  the cursor in the  toolbar.  Added new  mouse-wup-scroll
        commands that should be used instead.

        Calender day is off by one when going backwards to before 2004.

        Executing 'me' (user-setup -> Current) breaks  auto-spell until a main
        spell command (spell-word or spell-buffer) is executed.

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/23: Macro change.

    [040210] BS/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5

        There are  several  differences  between  running  'cvs' and using the
        'cvs-*'  commands  that can lead to  unexpected  and unwanted  results
        (e.g. use C-f10, select a couple of files and then execute cvs-commit,
        this will commit  changes to all files as it does not respect the list
        of selected  files).
        
        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/23: Macro change.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Minor - Target TBD

        CVS  directory  listing  looses  files  sometimes.  Deleted  files and
        sometimes new files fail to show in CVS directory  listing.  Unsure if
        it is CVS problem or ME problem. (sunos).

        Fixed JG/0401-5 04/02/29 Loosing signal lock synchronization.
        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/23 Code and macro change.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Minor - Target TBD

        CVS fails to show sometimes. Typically when done FTP (sunos).

        Fixed JG/0401-5 04/02/29 Loosing signal lock synchronization.

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        Add new narrow-search-forward and narrow-search-backward commands.

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/23 Code and macro change.

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        Would like a Select All and  Inverse  Selection  in the *files*  right
        mouse button menu to select all files/dirs in the listing

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/18: Macro change.
        
        Added  'Invert  Selection' to context menu, I don't think a select all
        is required as a 'Deselect All' followed by an 'Invert' does this.
        
     [040218] SP/0401-4 - Minor - TBD
     
        Add 'f5' refresh binding to a dir list buffer.

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/18: Macro change.
        
    [040129] JG/0401-1 - Major - Target 0401-5
    
        From  Organizer  -> Address,  do "Find" and search  "First" for a name
        that does not exist - Organiser locks up.

        Not  Reproducible - believe its caused by a very out of date sort list
        which would have caused problems. Running the Sort fixes the issue.
        
    [040212] SP/0401-4 - Enhancement - TBD
        
        Need some way of opening the right mouse button menu using a key.
        Also need so termcap bindings to open main and context menus.
        
        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/18: Source & Macro change.
        
        Created new context-menu command, bound to S-f1 and the windows 'menu'
        key (aka  windows)  and  created  binds to open  main menu (esc =) and
        context menu (esc +) on termcap platforms.

    [040216] SP/0401-4 - Major - Target TBD
        
        '2  popup-window'  does not work on an  XTerm,  no  implementation  in
        function meFrameXTermMakeCur.

        Fixed JG/0401-5 04/02/17: Source change.

    [040213] SP/0401-4 - Major - Target TBD
    
        CVS status of directories is not shown. Also add 'b' and 'o' file type
        flags.
        
        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/17: Macro change.

    [040210] BS/0401-4 - Minor - TBD

        ME build.bat -l options do not work in standard  cmd/command  as there
        use 4DOS '>>&' extension. 

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/16: Source change.
        
        Changed  to using  2>&1  which  works on cmd & 4nt but breaks 4Dos and
        command.

    [040213] SP/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5
    
        Bottom  Toolbar  window grows when CVS is opened,  change-window-depth
        does not respect bit 2 of $window-flags.
        
        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/16: Source change.

    [040213] BS/0401-4 - Minor - Target 0401-5

        Reframe  cvs-console better so the exit status can be easily seen from
        a small window.

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/16: Macro change.

    [040213] BS/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5
    
        PHP script can be started with '<?' tag in a php file.
        
        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/13: Macro change.
        
    [040210] DG/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5
    
        Toolbar Directory File List does not contain "../" - UNIX only. 

        Fixed 0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

    [040206] Th/0401-4 - Minor - Target 0401-5

        Document the create/delete/next-frame keys.

        Fixed JG/0401-5 04/02/13: Docs change.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target 0401-5

        Support to recognize GNU tags for makefile "-*- Makefile -*-" and UNIX
        shell files "-*- sh -*-".
        
        Fixed JS/0401-5 04/02/10: Macro change.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Critical - Target 0401-5

        On unix the $progname may not be fully  expanded (has just "me") which
        may  lead  to a  ctags  generation  error  and  an  alternate  fix  to
        $search-path.

        Fixed JG/0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5

        On unix,  find-file  of a symbolic  link which  points to a  directory
        results  in a bad dir  listing.  The list of files is correct  but the
        stats are all wrong (found on sunos 5.8).

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Critical - Target 0401-5

        UNIX the Copy and Paste is not  working  correctly  between  X-Windows
        applications.  Data selected in Mozilla  copies into GNU Emacs OK, but
        not into ME.
        
        Fixed JG/0401-5 04/02/09: Build Solaris 8 image.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Minor - Target 0401-5

        -n command line option to a console build causes a option  failure and
        the executable does not run.

        Fixed JG-SP/0401-5 04/02/08: Source change.

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5

        Fix  subtle  ftp bug with  alias  ftp  addressed.  Create  an ftp site
        "ftp://test/"  say with user name foo and  passwd bar and then load in
        "ftp://test/dir1/"   the  buffer  file  name  is   correctly   set  as
        "ftp://test/dir1/"  but the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line is set to
        "ftp://foo@test/dir1/".  Firstly  the  user  may  wish the 'foo' to be
        hidden but secondly  with the  introduction  of being able to click on
        the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line  this  has  introduced  a  subtle
        inefficiency/bug,   if  I  click  on  the   'foo@test'  ME  will  load
        "ftp://foo@test/"  not  "ftp://test/"  which  to  ME  is a  completely
        different file. This can in turn lead to "ftp://foo@test/dir1/"  being
        loaded so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being  loaded! The
        fix is to make  the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line  the  same,  i.e.
        "ftp://test/dir1/"

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

        ME does not work on a HP-UX console. Probably because termcap database
