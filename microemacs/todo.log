0401-4 Release Fixes
___________________________________________________________________________

    [040129] JG/0401-1 - Major - Target 0401-5
    
        From  Organizer  -> Address,  do "Find" and search  "First" for a name
        that does not exist - Organiser locks up.

    [040206] Th/0401-4 - Minor - Target 0401-5

        Document the create/delete/next-frame keys.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target 0401-5

        Support to recognize GNU tags for makefile "-*- Makefile -*-" and UNIX
        shell files "-*- sh -*-".
        
        Change already sent to SP

    [040203] Gabriel/0401-3 - Font selection under XP

        I have downloaded unix fonts from
        
            http://www.tomasek.cz/semtel/download/fonts.zip
            
        and I can't  get  them to work in ME. I can get  them to work on other
        programs (such as notepad) but not on ME.

        I have got 6x13 from somewhere else working, but that is too small for
        1280x960 (shame, it's my favourite programming font).

        I can  choose  the fonts from the list, but I cannot use them (it goes
        back to some other default font).
        
        Same problem under RC4.

    [040210] DG/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5
    
        Toolbar Directory File List does not contain "../" - UNIX only. 

        Fixed 0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Critical - Target 0401-5

        On unix the $progname may not be fully  expanded (has just "me") which
        may  lead  to a  ctags  generation  error  and  an  alternate  fix  to
        $search-path.

        Fixed JG/0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5

        On unix,  find-file  of a symbolic  link which  points to a  directory
        results  in a bad dir  listing.  The list of files is correct  but the
        stats are all wrong (found on sunos 5.8).

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Critical - Target 0401-5

        UNIX the Copy and Paste is not  working  correctly  between  X-Windows
        applications.  Data selected in Mozilla  copies into GNU Emacs OK, but
        not into ME.
        
        Fixed JG/0401-5 04/02/09: Build Solaris 8 image.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Minor - Target 0401-5

        -n command line option to a console build causes a option  failure and
        the executable does not run.

        Fixed JG-SP/0401-5 04/02/08: Source change.

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Major - Target 0401-5

        Fix  subtle  ftp bug with  alias  ftp  addressed.  Create  an ftp site
        "ftp://test/"  say with user name foo and  passwd bar and then load in
        "ftp://test/dir1/"   the  buffer  file  name  is   correctly   set  as
        "ftp://test/dir1/"  but the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line is set to
        "ftp://foo@test/dir1/".  Firstly  the  user  may  wish the 'foo' to be
        hidden but secondly  with the  introduction  of being able to click on
        the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line  this  has  introduced  a  subtle
        inefficiency/bug,   if  I  click  on  the   'foo@test'  ME  will  load
        "ftp://foo@test/"  not  "ftp://test/"  which  to  ME  is a  completely
        different file. This can in turn lead to "ftp://foo@test/dir1/"  being
        loaded so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being  loaded! The
        fix is to make  the  'Directory  listing  of:'  line  the  same,  i.e.
        "ftp://test/dir1/"

        Fixed SP/0401-5 04/02/10: Source change.

Subsequent Release
___________________________________________________________________________

    [040211] SP/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD
    
        Would like a system bit flag which when set stops ME from just exiting
        on C-x C-c. I  typically  have on main ME session and I do not want to
        exit this session, but due to miss types this often happens.
        
        Jon: Just re-bind the key to "void" or some smarter macro ??

    [040211] SP/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD
    
        evaluation  of ~fred/ on UNIX  should use the passwd file first to get
        the correct home directory of fred.

    [040210] BS/0401-4 - Minor - Not this release.

        There are  several  differences  between  running  'cvs' and using the
        'cvs-*'  commands  that can lead to  unexpected  and unwanted  results
        (e.g. use C-f10, select a couple of files and then execute cvs-commit,
        this will commit  changes to all files as it does not respect the list
        of selected  files). Also the use of a  *cvs-console*  or *cvs-commit*
        buffer. Should these differences be engineered out?    
        
    [040210] SP/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD
    
        Add support for deleting  directories to file-op and to  file-browser.
        This would also be used by upload's clean process. 

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Minor - Target TBD
    
        ME does not work on a HP-UX console. Probably because termcap database
        is not being used and built in definitions are being used to over-ride
        termcap. Need to revisit this.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Minor - Target TBD

        CVS fails to show sometimes. Typically when done FTP (sunos).

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Minor - Target TBD

        CVS  directory  listing  looses  files  sometimes.  Deleted  files and
        sometimes new files fail to show in CVS directory  listing.  Unsure if
        it is CVS problem or ME problem. (sunos).

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        Would like a Select All and  Inverse  Selection  in the *files*  right
        mouse button menu to select all files/dirs in the listing

    [040206] SP/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        Add new narrow-search-forward and narrow-search-backward commands.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        CVS has option not to open the dir-tree window, pain in butt.

    [040206] JG/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        Tags window in the tool-bar

    [040206] Th/0401-4 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        Support for multiple  pre-configured  print-layouts without setting up
        the printer.

    [040101] DG/0401-1 - Enhancement - Target TBD
    
        Support hierarchical favorites.

    [040101] BS/0401-1 - Enhancement - Target TBD
    
        New work notepad/todo list feature.

    [010101] JG/01 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        Native printer support for generation of postscript.

    [010101] SP/01 - Enhancement - Target TBD

        GNU Emacs compatibility macro file (Key bindings).
