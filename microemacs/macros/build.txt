BUILD 
     MicroEmacs '01 may  be compiled  from the  source files  using the command
     shell build scripts build (UNIX  Bourne Shell) or build.bat (DOS/Windows).
     A default compile sequence may be achieved with a simple: 

       build 

     from the command line. The build script attempts to detect the host system
     and available compiler and build the editor. 

     The build script recognizes the following options:- 

     -C   Build clean. Delete all of the object files. 

     -n   Build a  console  version (i.e.  no  window support).  Constructs the
          executable men32.exe on Windows, men on Linux. 

     -nu  Build a console  version with URL  support (Windows '95/'98/NT only),
          constructs the executable menu32.exe. 

     -d   Build a debugging  version, the  output is  med (or  med32 for 32-bit
          Windows versions)
