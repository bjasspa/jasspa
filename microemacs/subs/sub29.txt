The macro "spotless"  removes all inappropriate  white space from a file. This
includes  trailing  white space at the end of a line,  duplicate  blank lines.
Trailing blank lines from the end of the file.

Spotless  used to be a big  macro  and  since Dec 2002 has been  reduced  to a
simple name wrapper for the clean command. However there is something symbolic
about running  "spotless" when you have finished working on file, it basically
marks the end of development when you tidy the file and put it to bed !

Add the macros to your <user.emf> file and re-start the editor.

To run the command then "esc-x spotless"

==== spotless start =========================================================
; spotless; Perform a clean and remove any multi-blank lines.
define-macro spotless
    -1 clean
!emacro
==== spotless end ===========================================================
