/**
 * An ObjectOutputStream writes primitive data types and graphs of
 * Java objects to an OutputStream.  The objects can be read
 * (reconstituted) using an ObjectInputStream.
 * Persistent storage of objects can be accomplished by using a file for
 * the stream.
 * If the stream is a network socket stream, the objects can be reconsituted
 * on another host or in another process. <p>
 *
 * Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable interface can be
 * written to streams.
 *
 * The class of each serializable object is encoded including the class
 * name and signature of the class, the values of the
 * object's fields and arrays, and the closure of any other objects
 * referenced from the initial objects. <p>
 * 
 * The method <STRONG>writeObject</STRONG> is used to write an object
 * to the stream.  Any object, including Strings and arrays, is
 * written with writeObject. Multiple objects or primitives can be
 * written to the stream.  The objects must be read back from the
 * corresponding ObjectInputstream with the same types and in the same
 * order as they were written.<p>
 *
 * Primitive data types can also be written to the stream using the
 * appropriate methods from DataOutput. Strings can also be written
 * using the writeUTF method.<p>
 *
 * The default serialization mechanism for an object writes the class
 * of the object, the class signature, and the values of all
 * non-transient and non-static fields.  References to other objects
 * (except in transient or static fields) cause those objects to be
 * written also. Multiple references to a single object are encoded
 * using a reference sharing mechanism so that graphs of objects can
 * be restored to the same shape as when the original was written. <p>
 *
 * For example to write an object that can be read by the example in ObjectInputStream: <br>
 * <PRE>
 *	FileOutputStream ostream = new FileOutputStream("t.tmp");
 *	ObjectOutputStream p = new ObjectOutputStream(ostream);
 *
 *	p.writeInt(12345);
 *	p.writeObject("Today");
 *	p.writeObject(new Date());
 *
 *	p.flush();
 *	ostream.close();
 *
 * </PRE>
 *
 * Classes that require special handling during the serialization and deserialization
 * process must implement special methods with these exact signatures: <p>
 *
 * <PRE>
 * private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
 *     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException; 
 * private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
 *     throws IOException
 * </PRE><p>
 * The writeObject method is responsible for writing the state of
 * the object for its particular class so that the corresponding
 * readObject method can restore it.
 * The method does not need to concern itself with the
 * state belonging to the object's superclasses or subclasses.
 * State is saved by writing the individual fields to the ObjectOutputStream
 * using the writeObject method or by using the methods for
 * primitive data types supported by DataOutput. <p>
 *
 * Serialization does not write out the fields of any object that does
 * not implement the java.io.Serializable interface.  Subclasses of
 * Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case
 * the non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow
 * its fields to be initialized.  In this case it is the
 * responsibility of the subclass to save and restore the state of the
 * non-serializable class. It is frequently the case that the fields
 * of that class are accessible (public, package, or protected) or
 * that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore the
 * state. <p>
 *
 * Serialization of an object can be prevented by implementing writeObject
 * and readObject methods that throw the NotSerializableException.
 * The exception will be caught by the ObjectOutputStream and abort the
 * serialization process.
 *
 * Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to
 * assume complete control over the contents and format of the object's
 * serialized form.  The methods of the Externalizable interface,
 * writeExternal and readExternal, are called to save and restore the
 * objects state.  When implemented by a class they can write and read
 * their own state using all of the methods of ObjectOutput and
 * ObjectInput.  It is the responsibility of the objects to handle any
 * versioning that occurs.
