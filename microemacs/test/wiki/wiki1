* Description

Wiki-mode simulates wiki-pages (editable HTML-pages) and is
similar to Info mode and Wiki mode of GNU Emacs.

Buffer in wiki-mode is read-only. You can browse it using
cursor keys and special commands.

Text in wiki-style can document is splitted on nodes. Each node has
a headline. Headlines are the lines with asterisks at the first
position. The rest of the line is the node name. Node name must
begin and end with non-space character. Node name can contain any
characters except new-line.

* Hyperlinks

Text can contain hyperlinks to other node. Hyperlink begins
and end with ':'. No spaces allowed between ':' and first
or last character of the hyperlink. Hyperlink can contain another
file name and/or node name inside current or another file.

Hyperlink format is similar to URL: filename#nodename. For example,
the link :eEmacsRefMan: is a link to the file, :eEmacsRefMan#About:
is a link to the node About in eEmacsRefMan, and finally :#About:
is a local link to the node About in the current file.

* Mode-line

To turn wiki-mode on immediately after file is loaded, put
the following line to the first line of the file:

    -*- mode: wiki; -*-

You can turn wiki-mode on and off manually using C-c e.
