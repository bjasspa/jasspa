    <h1>Java Book List</h1>
    <p>
      
      Here are some books currently in print and soon anticipated
      about Java.  All books that are in print and which I've 
      had an opportunity to review get one of three ratings:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Buy It</dt>
      <dd>
        An essential book for any Java programmer.
      </dd>
      <dt>Browse It</dt>
      <dd>
        
        This book may be useful for some people. Skim through it in 
        your local bookstore to see if you like it before laying out
        your cash.
      </dd>
      <dt>Recycle It</dt>
      <dd>
        
        Toss it in the recycling bin.  ("Burn it" would have been
        more alliterative here, but I have a general aversion to 
        advocating book burning, even in jest. I also considered 
        "bag it" and "barf on it" at which I point I decided
        alliteration wasn't that important.). 
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      
      Note that these ratings are mutable depending on the 
      competition and the comparison between the book and the 
      current release of Java.  Generally a book's rating will 
      go down over time except when a new edition is released.
