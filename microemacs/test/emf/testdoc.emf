define-help test-doc 3
## NAME

__test-doc__ - print a test message given on the terminal
  
## SYNOPSIS

_n_ __test-doc__ ["*argument*"]

## DESCRIPTION

This is a test help page used to check formatting issues.

Lets display 'quotes' and "strings". There should be currently no hilight.

Formatting of lists:

- no space at the end _italic_
- space at the end _italic_ 
- no space at the end  __bold__
- space at the end  __bold__ 
- no space at the end *italic*
- space at the end *italic* 
- no space at the end  **bold**
- space at the end  **bold** 
- no space at the end  `typewriter`
- space at the end  `typewriter` 

Let's mix markup on one line such as  _italic_  __bold__ and `typewriter` on one line.

Same but with commas such as  _italic_, __bold__,  `typewriter`, and that on one line.

Now with spaces __some more text__ and _italic_ as well as `typewriter`, again on a line.

Indented code block should be untouched no replacements of underlines.

```
       ls _dir_
       dir
```

Now an example for MicroEmacs macro code using code fences:
       
```{emf}
      define-macro test
        ml-write @1
      !emacro  
```
