\section*{Actor}
\subsection*{Fixed group handling}
Group processing is currently disabled in the audio actor. 
When group processing is an integrated part of VC, the necessary
support should be added to the actor.
\subsection*{Test Mode}
Is it worth adding a test mode that allows configurations to be tested
without the rest of the {\em dVS} system running?  
The test mode would configure the audio setup and allow voice files to
be loaded and activated.
\subsection*{Simple Spatialisation}
We should be able to support simple spatialisation by panning sounds
and attentuating the volume.
Any device which allows the left and right channel volume to be
controlled independently whilst the sample is being played back should
be able to support this. 
\subsection*{ARS Integration}
At the moment the ARS support is a fudge in the Acoustetron II device
support. 
The support for the ARS element needs to be moved up into the actor,
and the actor/device interface defined and implemented. 
We need to work out how best to support this.
