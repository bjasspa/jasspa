This is an ISO-8859-1 encoded file with embedded Unicode escapes.

They are written  with an  backslash,  a lowercase u and a 4 or 5  hexadecimal
code. The next line gives an example:

This is a symbol: '\u2640' (Mars) and this is another: '\u2642' (Venus).

Here the text continues.

Let's take some symbols which are in ISO-8859-1.txt

£ is the pound @ and ²³¼½. There is no need to encode them. ISO 8859-1 as well
knows back and forward ticks which are sometimes used to `quote´ things.

If we like to write the Euro symbol we have in ISO-8859-1 as well use Unicode,
the Euro has the symbol '20ac' and can be written like here: '\u20ac'.

Using the little python script  ascii2utf8.py which is in the contribs folder,
we can convert this file to an UTF-8 encoded text file like this;


```
ascii2utf8.py iso-8859-1.txt utf8.txt
```
