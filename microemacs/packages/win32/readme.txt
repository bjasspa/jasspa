For building the installer for windows you need the following:

Microsoft HTML Compiler
Inno Setup - isetup-5.3.4

Run  the  shell  script  setup.sh  this  downloads  and  installs  all  of the
components  from   www.jasspa.com  and  installs  them  into  the  appropriate
directory for building.

Then simply build the bundle using Inno.
