NanoEmacs

    Small footprint version of MicroEmacs. This runs with minimum
    configuration. For Windows then ne.emf is usually required to
    perform  some of the window and language  configuration.  For
    UNIX then ne.emf is not  required and will run stand alone in
    console mode.

    This may be run straight from the CD-ROM.
