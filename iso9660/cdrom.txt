THE JASSPA CDROM

Introduction

    The JASSPA  CD-ROM is a collection  of all of the software on
    www.jasspa.com  bundled onto a single CD-ROM. The  motivation
    for doing this was to be able to move  between  machines  and
    still be able to run JASSPA's MicroEmacs without having to do
    a complete installation.

    Having  discovered  "cdrecord"  and  "mkisofs"  on UNIX  then
    putting  together  a  single  media  source  for any  machine
    becomes  feasible. Now one can build a complete hybrid CD-ROM
    to be read on any platform using a "make" script the likes of
    Roxio "Easy CD Creator"  are history and writing  CD-ROMs can
    become automated, repeatable and easily maintained.

CD-ROM

    The CD-ROM's have been prepared as a hybrid ISO9660 image for
    any system,  supporting  Microsoft  Joliet,  UNIX High Sierra
    with Rock Ridge extensions and Apple HFS file systems.

    Any   duplication  of  the  CDs  may  result  in  a  loss  of
    information   without  the  appropriate   master  disk  image
    (jasspa0212.iso).

CD Labels

    Labels for the CD-ROM are included in the CD-ROM  image, burn
    the CD-ROM and then print the labels from the CD-ROM.

    The source labels  generated  with  SureThing  CD/DVD Labeler
